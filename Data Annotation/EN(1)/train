eventually O
it O

crashing O

I O
read O
reviews O

I O
thought O

may O
be O
it O

I O
have O
never O

Again O
in O

my O

I O
contacted O

thru O
my O
Warrenty O

it O
took O
about O
3 O
days O
fighting O
on O
the O

with O

and O
it O
seemed O
as O
though O
NONE O

spoke O
English O

The O
wait B-positive
staff I-positive
is O
very O
courteous O

The O

The O

if O

I O
have O
to O
highly O
recommend O
the O
lobster B-positive

- O
not O
to O
much O
mayo O
; O
you O
can O
tell O
it O
was O
a O
fresh O

The O

did O
take O
a O
few O
extra O
minutes O
to O
come O
, O
but O
the O
cute O
waiters B-positive
' O
jokes O

made O
up O

The O

I O
even O

a O

who O

it O

one O
of O
the O
best O

other O
dishes B-positive
for O
a O
change O
include O
chicken O

This O
made O
it O
obvious O
that O
the O
food B-negative
was O
n't O
cooked O
fresh O
; O
it O
was O
obviously O
made O
before O
hand O
and O
then O
reheated O
. O

I O
had O
the O
same O
reasons O
as O
most O
PC O
users O
: O
the O
price O
, O
the O
overbearing O
restrictions O
of O
OSX B-negative
and O
lack O
of O

for I-negative

. O

Its O
also O
FUN O
to O
use B-positive
! O

If O
your O
visiting O

you O
'll O
enjoy O
the O

the O
fact O
that O
it O

It O
is O
short O

The O
2.9ghz B-positive
dual-core I-positive
i7 I-positive
chip I-positive
really O
out O
does O
itself O
. O

That O
is O
a O
problem O
since O
we O
paid O
about O
20 O
bucks O
a O
dish O
, O
and O
had O
to O
order O
5 O
dishes O
to O
get O
a O
decent O
taste B-neutral
. O

Not O
a O
typical O
pizza O
joint O
, O
but O
good O
for O
a O
low O
key O
and O
fairly O
cheap O
nice O
sit O

If O
I O
wanted O
to O
deal O

annoying O
customers B-negative
I O
'd O
go O
out O
in O
Manhattan O
. O

Drinks B-negative
way O
over O
priced O
. O

The O
location B-neutral
and O
ambience B-neutral
is O
Ok O
but O
the O
food O
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

Came O
fully O
loaded B-positive
- O
good O
. O

Even O
if O
the O

this O
good O
, O
the O

is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O

relax O

The O
sake B-positive
menu I-positive
should O
not O
be O
overlooked O
! O

The O
staff B-positive
is O
no O
nonsense O
. O

CONS O
: O
Price B-negative
is O
a O
bit O
ridiculous O
, O
kinda O
heavy O
. O

It O
is O
the O
type O
of O
place O
to O
run O
into O
old O
friends O
and O
have O
a O
late O
, O
raucous O
dinner B-positive
. O

The O
miso B-negative
soup I-negative
lacked O
flavor B-negative
and O
the O
fish B-negative
was O
unfortunately O
not O
as O
well O
prepared O
as O
in O
the O
past O

Now O
, O
, O
, O
, O
, O
my O
monitor B-negative
has O
been O
acting O
up O
for O
about O
2 O
months O

The O
sashimi B-positive
was O
the O
freshest O
and O
most O
tender O
I O
have O
ever O
tasted O
. O

Great O
beer B-positive
selection I-positive
too O
, O
something O
like O
50 O
beers B-neutral
. O

The O
buttons B-negative
you O
have O
to O
press O
a O
little O
harder O
than O
most O
. O

This O
is O
definitely O
an O
excellent O
date O
spot B-positive
because O
of O
the O
ambiance O
and O
on O
the O
weekends O
the O
night B-positive
scene I-positive
is O
more O
than O
alive O
. O

They O
have O
great O
rolls B-positive
, O
the O
triple B-positive
color I-positive
and I-positive
norwegetan I-positive
rolls I-positive
, O
are O
awesome O

Awsome O
Pizza B-positive
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-positive

All O
in O
all O
, O
this O
midtown O
gem O
instantly O
became O
one O
of O
my O

I O

I O
obviously O

The O

wonderful O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-positive
souvlaki I-positive
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

Not O
only O
do O
they O
have O
the O
best O
escargot B-positive
in O

, O
they O
always O
try O
to O
accomodate O
our O

a O

Service B-negative
could O

overall O
this O

a O

( O
the O

's O
constantly O
open O
, O
catering O
to O
the O
Pakistani O
cabbies O
lined O
up O
on O
Crosby O
St. O
, O
so O
there O
's O
more O
turnover O
with O
the O
food B-positive
than O
you O
'd O
expect O
( O
i.e. O
, O
surprisingly O
fresh O
) O
. O

Excellent O
food B-positive
for O
great O
prices O

Warm O

in O
the O

terrific O
outdoor B-positive

For O
the O

the O

are O
very O
reasonable O
. O

The O
tables B-negative
are O
crammed O
way O
too O
close O
, O
the O
menu B-neutral
is O
typical O
of O
any O
Italian O
restaurant O
, O
and O
the O
wine B-negative
list I-negative
is O
simply O
overpriced O
. O

Guacamole+shrimp B-positive
appetizer I-positive
was O
really O
great O
, O
we O
both O
had O
the O
filet B-positive
, O
very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O

that O
came O
with O

but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O

I O
like O
those O

The O

love O
the O

big O
enough O
for O

I O
use O
it O
for O

the O
worst O

my O

An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O

, O
the O

I O
tried O

The O

Overall O
, O
I O
experienced O
a O
huge O
change O
in O
that O
my O
mac O
runs B-positive
pretty O
fast O
compared O
to O
my O
old O

Because O
we O
did O

we O
could O
only O

the O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
Apple O
keeps O
making O
the O
same O
mistake O
with O

to O
USB B-negative
ports I-negative

He O
loves O
it O

it O
is O
easy O
to O
use B-positive
and O
well O
the O

it O

The O
one O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
the O
service B-positive
was O
prompt O
, O
we O
got O
seated O
right O
away O
and O
the O
server B-positive
was O
very O

I O
highly O
recommend O
the O

everything O

The O

I O

had O
better O

Service B-positive

very O
good O

Nice O

from O
a O

to O

, O
to O
escargot B-neutral
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
delicious O
- O
they O
use O
fresh O
mozzarella O
instead O
of O
the O
cheap O
, O
frozen O
, O
shredded O
cheese O
common O
to O
most O
pizzaria O

The O
menu B-negative
is O
limited O
but O
almost O
all O
of O
the O

excellent O
. O

Note O

If O
we O
were O
to O
move O
from O
the O

we O
would O
genuinely O
miss O
this O
restaurant B-positive

I O
have O
had O
so O
many O
dinners B-positive
here O

it O

always O

a O

The O
menu B-negative
changed O

even O

a O

a O

One O
caveat O

Some O
of O
the O

be O
a O
trifle O

The O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O

was O
good O

but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-negative
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O

thought O
that O
this O

Even O
the O

I O
normally O

good O

The O
store O
honored O
their O
warrenty O
and O
made O
the O
comment O
that O
they O
do O
n't O
even O
recommend O
the O
HP O
brand O
because O
of O
the O
problems O
with O
their O
warrentys B-negative

I O
would O
not O
have O
been O

disappointed O

the O
portions B-negative
if O
the O
qualities B-negative

good O
enough O
to O
make O
up O

it O

but O
they O

not O

Typically O

when O

An O

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O
review O
for O
a O
restaurant O
because O
the O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
food B-negative
is O
n't O
cheap O
at O
all O
compared O
to O
Chinatown O
. O

The O
sommelier B-positive
is O
fantastic O
, O
down-to-earth O
, O
& O
extremely O
knowlegable O

I O
love O

The O
place B-negative

small O

intimate O
and O
you O
may O
feel O
a O
little O
crowded O
, O
but O
the O
service B-positive
is O
excellent O
and O
it O
's O
great O
for O
friends O
out O
, O
a O
romantic O
date O
, O
or O
a O
special O
occassion O

The O
place B-positive
is O
a O
BISTRO O
which O
means O
: O
simple O
dishes B-positive
and O
wine B-positive
served I-positive
efficiently O
in O
a O
bustling O

Then O
it O
ceased O
charging B-negative
at O
all O
. O

How O
Toshiba O
handles O
the O

seems O
to O
vary O
, O
some O
folks O
indicate O
that O
they O
were O
charged O
for O
even O
an O
intial O
fix O
, O
others O
had O
the O
repair O
done O
5 O
times O

The O
food B-positive
is O
above O
average O
for O
midtown O
and O
sligtly O
better O
than O
some O
of O
the O
other O
Heartland O
Breweries O
in O
the O

It O
is O
absolutely O
horrible O
to O
use B-negative

despite O
all O
its O
so O
called O
advanced O

While O
there O
are O
plenty O

a O
good O
corned B-positive
beef I-positive

, O
Katz O

has O
a O
charm O
about O
it O

But O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

Luckily O
, O
for O
all O
of O
us O
contemplating O
the O
decision O
, O
the O
Mac O
Mini O
is O
priced B-positive
just O
right O
. O

And O
the O
screen B-positive
on O
this O
thing O
is O
absolutely O
amazing O
for O
high O
quality O

movies O
and O
gaming B-positive
. O

The O
stuff B-negative
tilapia I-negative
was O
horrid O
... O
tasted O
like O

We O
ordered O
the O
special O
, O
grilled B-negative
branzino I-negative
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O

If O
you O
want O
a O
casual O
neighborhood O

that O
has O
great O
food B-positive

excellent O
service B-positive
, O
this O
is O
the O
place O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
well O
prepared O

The O
potato B-positive
balls I-positive
were O
not O

in O

it O

Go O

an O
all O
out O

the O

the O
staff B-negative
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O

they O
were O
very O
rude O

Drawbacks O
: O
service B-negative

the O
food B-negative

good O
, O
so O
I O
would O
come O

The O
veal B-positive

it O

the O
best O

The O

it O
feels O

their O
Grilled B-neutral

The O
service B-negative
was O
poor O
, O
restaurant O
poorly O
lit O
, O
staff B-negative
not O
very O
attentive O
and O
I O
would O
have O
rather O
eaten O
at O
a O
Mcdonald O

than O
this O
joint O
. O

Metrazur O
has O
a O
beautiful O
spot B-positive

While O
I O
quite O
liked O
the O
food B-positive
and O
the O
ambience B-positive
, O
I O
'm O
not O
quite O
sure O
if O
it O
they O
really O
deserve O
it O
the O
Michelin O
rating O
they O
have O
displayed O
so O
prooudly O
in O
the O
window O
. O

Great O
food B-positive

great O
prices O
, O
great O
service B-positive

I O
tried O
a O
couple O
other O
dishes B-neutral

too O
impressed O
. O

Tiny O
dessert B-negative
was O
$ O
8.00 O

just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O

. O

I O
found O
the O
food B-positive

service B-positive
and O
value O
exceptional O
everytime O
I O
have O
been O
there O

Traditional B-positive
French I-positive
decour I-positive
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-negative

rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O

to O
be O

I O
also O
recommend O
the O
garlic B-positive

The O
side B-neutral
dishes I-neutral
were O
passable O
, O
and O
I O
did O
get O
a O
refill O
upon O
request O

I O
found O
it O
on O
a O
cold O
night O
, O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
to O
warm O
up O
. O

I O
think O
the O
meatball B-positive

is O
good O
. O

Best O

The O
halibut B-neutral
cheek I-neutral
appetizer I-neutral
came O
with O
a O
generous O
portion B-positive
of I-positive
foie I-positive

, O
but O
that O
's O
about O
the O
only O
positive O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
the O
meal O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
, O
but O
they O
were O
very O
friendly O

It O

well O
worth O
the O
money O
it O

Very O
good O

The O
crust B-positive

the O

The O

too O
since O

It O
is O
easy O

good O

Two O
complaints O

their O
appetizer B-negative
selection I-negative
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O

Skip O
this O
restaurant B-negative

it O

a O
big O
disappointment O
. O

Moules B-positive
were O
excellent O
, O
lobster B-negative
ravioli I-negative

VERY O
salty O
! O

The O
pasta B-negative
penne I-negative
was O
pretty O
extra O
buttery O
, O
creamy O
which O
means O
a O
big O
task O
to O
diggest.. O
tasty O
at O
first O
but O
i O
would O
say O
that O
i O
was O
full O
with O
a O
slice O
of O
pizza O
and O
7 O
to O
count O
, O
penne O
... O
got O
a O
little O
moody O
afterwards O
cause O
was O
stuffed O
... O
lol O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-positive
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

The O
waitress B-positive
remembers O
me O
and O
is O
very O
friendly O
, O
she O
knows O
what O
my O
regular O

yes O

It O

a O

I O

considering O
it O

a O
short O

I O
can O
only O
give O
it O
1 O

implore O
anyone O
looking O

to O
stay O
away O

this O

When O
you O

sitting O
in O

what O

the O
best O
gyros B-positive
in O
New O

. O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O

It O

fine O
with O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-positive
food I-positive
, O
look O
no O
further O
than O
Toons O

Found O
service B-positive
above O
average O
, O
but O
that O
could O
be O
because O
we O
were O
13 O
of O
us O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
quick O
. O

It O
's O
priced B-positive
very O
reasonable O

very O
well O
right O
out O

the O

Food B-neutral

the O

saves O
it O

at O
your O

it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O

The O
Thai B-positive
ice I-positive

was O
amazingly O
smooth O
and O
yummy O

The O
appetizing B-positive

just O
as O
good O
as O
Zabars O

We O
always O

The O
spicy O

probably O
the O
best O
that O
I O
've O
had O
at O

Everything O

the O

even O
the O

My O

It O
takes O
forever O
to O
get O

almost O
always O
forget O
to O
bring O
something O
( O
although O
they O

to O
charge O
you O
for O
it O

I O
complained O
to O
the O
manager B-negative
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
even O
apologetic O
. O

It O
is O
in O
the O
best O
condition O
and O
has O
a O
really O
high O
quality B-positive
. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
will O
usually O
only O
order O
one O
primi O
and O
one O
secondi O
and O
split O
them O
, O
as O
they O
tend O
to O
offer O
large O
portions B-positive

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-positive
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

The O
cuisine B-neutral
from O
what O
I O
've O
gathered O
is O
authentic O
Taiwanese O
, O
though O
its O
very O
different O
from O
what O
I O
've O
been O
accustomed O
to O
in O
Taipei O
. O

Owner B-positive
is O
pleasant O
and O
entertaining O

Easily O
the O
worst O
stir-fried B-negative
squid I-negative
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
. O

An O
awesome O
organic O
dog B-positive
, O
and O
a O
conscious O
eco O

The O
menu B-positive
looked O
good O
, O
except O
for O
offering O
the O
Chilean B-negative
Sea I-negative
Bass I-negative
, O
but O
the O
server O
does O
not O
offer O
up O
the O
specials O
that O
were O
written O
on O
the O
board O
outside O
. O

Not O
sure O
where O
the O
previous O
reviewer O
, O
lonk O
, O
dined O
, O
but O
Saul O
is O
in O
a O
great O
neighborhood B-positive

So O
happy O

The O
hot B-negative
dogs I-negative

cold O

This O

the O
best O
interior B-positive
I O
have O
seen O
anywhere O

the O
northside O

impress O
whoever O
you O
bring O
there O

Great O
food B-positive

the O

The O
food B-negative
was O
all O
good O
but O
it O
was O
way O
too O
mild O
. O

The O
only O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
manager B-negative
is O
a O
complete O
incompetent O
. O

BUt O
their O
best O
dish B-positive
is O
thh O
Thai B-positive
spiced I-positive
curry I-positive
noodles I-positive
with I-positive
shrimp I-positive
- O
a O
dish O
that O
would O
cost O
$ O
23.95 O
is O
most O
places O

but O
it O
is O
$ O
16 O
here O

The O
quantity B-positive
is O
also O
very O
good O

you O
will O
come O

Not O

how O
I O

it O

If O
you O

the O

this O

The O
last O
two O

my O

soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O

the O

took O
away O
from O
the O

His O

so O
was O
the O
atmosphere B-positive

and O
its O
not O
hard O
to O
accidentally O
bang O
it O
against O
something O
so O
i O
recommend O
getting O
a O
case B-neutral
to O
protect O
it O
. O

Even O
though O
its O
good O
seafood B-positive
, O
the O
prices B-negative
are O
too O
high O
. O

I O
like O
Cafe B-positive
Noir I-positive
dont O
get O
me O
wrong O
, O
it O
is O
jsut O
that O
the O
people B-negative
who O
work O

are O
evil O

incompetent O
! O
! O

( O
No O

Normally O
that O
would O
be O
improper O

however O
they O
were O
all O
delicious O

my O

not O

This O

QPR O

The O
regular B-neutral

One O
drawback O
I O
noticed O
was O
sound B-negative
quality I-negative

I O
was O
looking O
too O
closely O
at O
the O

while O
comparing O

I O
took O
it O
for O
granted O
that O
these O

were O
standard O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
it O
is O
reasonably O
priced B-positive

Even O
when O
the O

is O
not O
in O
the O

the O
food B-positive

are O
right O
on O
target O

Went O
here O
last O
night O

nice O
decor B-positive

good O
service B-positive
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O

I O
ordered O
the O
smoked B-negative
salmon I-negative

roe I-negative

it O

The O
entree B-negative

small O

The O

are O
not O
as O
small O
as O
some O
of O
the O
reviews O
make O
them O
out O

When O

Only O
suggestion O

that O
you O
skip O
the O

it O
was O
overpriced O

fell O
short O

the O

Without O
a O

, O
the O

of O

the O

They O

they O
even O

which O
oceans O

come O
from O

Atlantic O

The O

uncomfortable O
if O

sitting O
against O
the O

on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

Horrible O
food B-negative
and O
horrible O
service B-negative
. O

Typing O
on O
the O

becomes O
uncomfortable O
after O
extended O
use O
due O
to O
the O
sharp O
edges B-negative
that O
your O

Great O

Fan B-negative
noise O
: O
The O
fan B-negative
made O
a O
constant O
hissing O
noise O
in O
the O
background O
. O

I O
thought O
the O
restaurant B-positive
was O
nice O
and O
clean O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
extensive O
and O
can O
easily O
hike O
up O
an O
otherwise O
reasonably O

meal B-positive

Service B-negative
was O
slow O
had O
to O
wait O
to O
order O
and O
get O
food O
although O
not O
crowded O
. O

Overall O
, O
I O
'm O
still O
impressed O
that O
the O
place O
even O
exists O
and O
the O
prices B-positive
are O
quite O
decent O
but O
then O
again O
, O
its O
Chinatown O
. O

The O
traditional B-positive
Italian I-positive
items I-positive
are O
great O
- O
cheap O
and O
served O
in O
a O
cozy O
setting B-positive

All O
of O
the O

( O

Numbers B-neutral
) O
have O
an O
option O
to O
save O
your O

as O
Microsoft O
compatible O
, O
which O
really O
eliminates O
the O
need O
for O
the O
actual O
. O

The O
food B-negative
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-negative
were O
bland O
and O
very O
oily O
. O

Great O
staff B-positive
. O

Best O
food B-positive
, O
phenominal O

So O
, O
the O
menu B-neutral
is O
written O
in O
chalk O
above O
your O
head O
and O
it O
all O
sounds O
delicious O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O

Right O
off O
the O

place B-positive
with O
good O

The O
crust B-positive
is O
thin O
, O
the O
ingredients B-positive
are O
fresh O
and O
the O
staff B-positive
is O
friendly O
. O

It O
should O
n't O
happen O
like O
that O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
design B-neutral

My O
steak B-negative
au I-negative

was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
I O
've O
had O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
longer O

life I-positive
than O
other O
computers O
( O
I O
have O
several O
friends O
who O
still O
use O
the O
older O
Apple O
PowerBooks O

. O

I O
highly O
recommend O
to O
anyone O
to O
give O
this O
place B-positive
a O
try O

The O
rolls B-positive
are O
creative O
and O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
find O
another O
sushi O
place O
that O
serves O
up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O
japanese B-positive
food I-positive

If O
you O
like O

the O
chicken B-positive
vindaloo I-positive
. O

You O
will O
pay O
a O
lot O
for O
the O
decore B-negative
, O
but O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
no O
better O
or O
worse O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
Chinese O

Asian O
fusion O
places O
in O
NY O

The O
memory B-negative
was O
gone O
and O
it O
was O
not O
able O
to O

Yamato B-positive
is O
an O

The O
location B-neutral

is O
Ok O

the O
food O
is O
what O
makes O
up O
for O
it O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
great O
and O
tasty O
, O
but O
the O
sitting B-negative
space I-negative
was O
too O
small O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
being O
cramp O
in O
a O
corner O
. O

Also O
, O
I O
have O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
with O
the O
keys B-negative
sticking O
and O
will O
not O
type O

In O
the O
evening O
, O
this O

attracted O
a O
well O
dressed O
, O
with O
it O
, O
NY O
crowd B-positive
. O

The O
food B-negative
can O
get O
pricey O

the O

fixe I-positive
tasting I-positive
menu I-positive
is O
the O
greatest O

for O
a O

all O

It O

So O
I O
called O

support I-positive
( O
which O
is O
good O

) O
and O
they O
went O
through O
it O
and O
it O
is O
just O
a O
safety O
feature O
and O
it O
does O
not O
affect O
performance B-neutral
at O
all O
, O
I O
just O
chose O
to O
hide O
the O
message O

Overall O
, O
not O
worth O
the O
money B-negative

This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
writing O
a O

the O
food B-positive

Clear O

on O
it O

everything O

This O

if O

not O

its O

On O
my O
PowerBook O

I O
would O
never O
use O
the O

I O
would O
use O
an O

I O
did O

like O
the O

It O
has O
all O
the O
expected O

and O
more O
+plus O
a O
wide O
screen B-positive
and O
more O
than O
roomy O

I O
acually O
believe O
the O
issue O
is O
with O
the O
Nvidia B-negative
grafics I-negative
card I-negative
, O
but O
still O
requires O
a O
return O

There O

another O

I O
ca O
n't O
describe O

she O
is O
about O
5'6 O

with O
brown O

who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O

chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O

The O
place B-positive
is O
small O

intimate O

you O
may O
feel O
a O

the O

it O

It O

I O
picked O
the O

The O
decor B-positive
in O
this O

very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O

sparse O
. O

It O
is O
really O
thick O
around O
the O

The O

due O
to O
the O

The O

The O

now O

oh O
speaking O
of O

the O

The O
shrimp B-positive

the O

The O

confident O
all O

from O

It O

simply O
the O
best O

in O
NYC O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
was O

this O

When O

I O

Can O
’ O
t O
believe O
how O
an O
expensive O
NYC O

can O
be O
so O
disrespectful O

My O
father O
had O
the O
flank B-positive
steak I-positive

was O
very O
good O

and O
my O
mother O
had O
the O

I O

I O
have O
been O
to O
this O

folks O

it O

Some O

other O

The O

always O
well O

The O
food B-neutral
was O
mediocre O
at O

but O
it O
was O
the O
horrible O
service B-negative
that O
made O
me O
vow O
never O
to O
go O
back O
. O

Mermaid B-positive
Inn I-positive
is O
an O
overall O
good O
restaurant O
with O
really O
good O
seafood B-positive

Personally O
I O
like O
the O
margherita B-positive
pizza I-positive
better O
, O
but O
they O
are O
all O
good O

A O
con O

The O
bread B-negative
we O
received O

horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
`` O
free O
'' O
appetizer B-neutral
of I-neutral
olives I-neutral
was O
disappointing O
. O

It O
is O
VERY O
easy O
to O
type B-positive
on O
and O
feels O
great O
- O
besides O
the O
added O
feature B-positive
that O
the O
keyboard B-positive
is O
lighted O
. O

The O
place B-positive
itself O
is O
beautiful O
the O
bar O
scene O
seems O
to O
be O
happening O

It O
is O
good O
to O
know O
that O
I O
can O
mobilize O

Great O

I O
would O
highly O

! O

The O
owners B-positive
and O
employees B-positive
are O
friendly O
and O
their O
pizza B-positive
is O
fantastic O
. O

not O
sure O
why O
this O
restaurant B-negative
would O
be O
rated O
that O
highly O
. O

I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
SEA O
if O
you O
like O
thai B-positive
cuisine I-positive
! O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-negative
is O
poor O
. O

And O
their O
prices B-negative
are O
very O
high O
- O
they O
actually O
think O
that O
they O
can O
get O
away O
with O
charging O
such O
prices O
for O
such O
terrible O
food B-negative
and O
service B-negative
! O

: O

It O
arrived O
so O
fast O
and O
customer B-positive
service I-positive
was O
great O

Always O
great O
service B-positive
! O

After O
the O
warrenty O
expired O
the O
hard B-negative
drive I-negative
went O
bad O
and O
it O
would O
have O
cost O
more O
to O
fix O
then O
to O
replace O

my O
service B-positive
was O
stellar O
! O

Authentic O
Pakistani B-positive
food I-positive
. O

Web B-positive
surfuring I-positive
is O
smooth O
and O
seamless O
. O

The O
food B-positive
-- O
though O
mostly O
deep-fried O
-- O
is O
simple O
and O
satisfying O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-negative
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-negative
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-positive
and O
atmosphere B-positive
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-negative
and O
service B-negative
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

The O
dim B-negative
sum I-negative
is O
ok O
but O
does O
n't O
taste O
that O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
little B-negative
dishes I-negative
do O
n't O
look O
steamy O
hot O
as O
they O
should O
( O
also O
note O
lack O
of O
Chinese O
here O
) O
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
vibrant O
and O
eye-pleasing O
with O
several O
semi-private B-positive
boths I-positive
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
dining O
hall O
, O
which O
are O
great O
for O
a O

The O
pizza B-negative

overpriced O

soggy O

– O
I O
will O
never O

the O
amazing O

the O

is O
slow O

they O
had O
to O
replace O
the O

in O
April O

However O
, O
I O
think O
Jeckll B-positive

Hydes I-positive
t O
is O
one O
of O
those O
places O
that O
is O
fun O
to O
do O
once O

It O
's O
a O
rather O
cramped O
and O
busy O
restaurant B-negative

it O
closes O
early O

a O
nicely O

The O

I O

, O
which O
was O
wonderful O
. O

even O
the O
wine B-positive
by I-positive
the I-positive

was O
good O

It O
is O
so O
nice O
not O
to O
worry O
about O
that O
and O
the O
extra O
expense O
that O
comes O
along O
with O
the O
necessary O
virus B-positive
protection I-positive
on O

i O
happen O
to O
have O
a O
policy O
that O
goes O
along O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
self-respect O

which O
includes O
not O
letting O
a O
waiter B-negative
intimidate O
me O

i.e O

make O
me O
feel O
bad O
asking O
for O
trivialities O

the O

Having O
heard O
from O
friends O

about O
how O
reliable O
a O

I O
never O
expected O

I O
did O

It O

First O
off O

the O

was O
completely O
unattentive O
the O
2 O

we O
saw O
her O
( O
odd O
in O
a O
restaurant O
with O
6 O

and O
got O
our O

wrong O

I O
have O
to O
say O
they O
have O
one O
of O
the O
fastest O
delivery B-positive
times I-positive
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
lobster B-negative
knuckles I-negative
( O
special O
of O
the O

were O
ok O

pretty O
tasteless O

I O
thought O
the O
price B-positive
was O
great O
for O
the O

Not O
a O
very O

very O
good O
Chinese B-positive

I O

It O

I O

I O
am O
relatively O
new O

tried O
Pick O
a O
bgel O
on O
2nd O

was O
disappointed O
with O
the O
service B-negative
and O
I O
thought O
the O
food B-negative
was O
overated O
and O
on O
the O
pricey O
side O
. O

Our O
waiter B-negative
was O
non-existent O
and O
after O
our O
food O
finally O
arrived O
over O
an O
hour O
after O
we O
ordered O
, O
we O
were O
not O
given O
any O

Melt O

your O
mouth O
nigiri O

sashmi O

and O
very O
tasty O
rolls B-positive
too O
. O

The O
feel B-positive

better O

too O

But O
nonetheless O
-- O
great O
spot B-positive

great O

And O
really O
large O
portions B-positive
. O

the O
spinach B-positive
is O
fresh O

I O
paid O
just O
about O
$ O
60 O
for O
a O
good O
meal B-positive
, O
though O

Another O
thing O
is O
that O
after O
only O
a O
month O
the O

broke O
and O
it O
costed O
$ O
175 O

send O
it O

it O

We O
were O
so O
happy O
with O
our O
food B-positive

were O
even O
more O
thrilled O
when O
we O
saw O
the O

I O
loved O
everythig O
about O

I O
can O
say O
this O

one O
of O
the O

I O
've O
had O
. O

Chennai B-positive
Garden I-positive
is O
my O
favorite O
Indian O
restaurant O
in O
the O
city O

First O
off O
, O
I O
really O
do O
like O
my O
MBP O
... O
once O
used O
to O
the O
OS B-positive
it O
is O
pretty O
easy O
to O
get O
around O
, O
and O
the O
overall B-positive
build I-positive
is O
great O
... O
eg O
the O
keyboard B-positive
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
to O
type O
on O
. O

One O
of O
the O
earlier O
people O
commenting O
on O
the O
restaurant O
did O
not O
get O
the O
that O
some O
experimenting O
is O
going O
on O
with O
the O
menu B-positive
in O
a O
positive O
way O
. O

Friendly O
staff B-positive
that O
actually O
lets O
you O
enjoy O
your O
meal B-positive
and O
the O
company O
you O
're O
with O
. O

The O
family B-positive
seafood I-positive
entree I-positive
was O
very O
good O
. O

I O
thought O
learning O
the O
Mac B-positive
OS I-positive
would O
be O
hard O
, O
but O
it O
is O
easily O
picked O
up O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
a O
PC O
. O

The O
comments O
about O
fried O
foods O
is O
correct O
( O
below O
) O
but O
the O
other O
dishes B-positive
, O
including O
the O
lamb B-positive
entree I-positive
and O
many O
of O
the O
salads B-positive
( I-positive
avocado I-positive
shrimp I-positive
) I-positive
were O
quite O
good O
. O

Two O
complaints- O
their O
appetizer B-negative
selection I-negative
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
manager O
then O
told O
us O
we O
could O
order O
from O
whatever O
menu O
we O
wanted O
but O
by O
that O
time O
we O
were O
so O
annoyed O
with O
the O
waiter B-negative
and O
the O
resturant O
that O
we O
let O
and O
went O
some O
place O
else O
. O

I O
have O
been O
here O
, O
spent O
tons O
of O
money O
on O
a O
chef B-negative
special I-negative
dinner I-negative
and O
it O
was O
a O
major O
dissappointment O
. O

It O
has O
just O
enough O
RAM B-positive
to O
run O
smoothly O
and O
enough O
memory B-positive
to O
satisfy O
my O
needs O
. O

The O
laptop O
is O
very O
lightweight O
, O
can O
easily O
carry B-positive
around O
in O
a O
knapsack O
full O
of O
text O
books O
and O
it O
barely O
adds O
any O
weight B-positive
. O

Once O
we O
sailed O
, O
the O
top-notch O
food B-positive
and O
live B-positive
entertainment I-positive
sold O
us O
on O
a O
unforgettable O
evening O
. O

This O
place B-negative
is O
incredibly O
tiny O
. O

Try O
the O
spicy B-positive
wontons I-positive
and O
the O
salt B-positive
pepper I-positive
shrimps I-positive
. O

At O
peak O
times O
, O
the O
restaurant O
is O
overcrowded O
and O
tables B-negative
are O
uncomfortably O
close O
. O

I O
had O
fish B-positive
and O
my O
husband O
had O
the O
filet B-positive
- O
both O
of O
which O
exceeded O
our O
expectations O
. O

I O
also O
ordered O
the O
Change B-positive
Mojito I-positive
, O
which O
was O
out O
of O
this O
world O
. O

There O
are O
so O
many O
wonderful O
features B-positive
and O
benefits O
to O
the O
new O
MacBook O
! O

Great O
food B-positive
, O
great O
drinks B-positive
, O
nice O
dining B-positive
atmosphere I-positive
. O

The O
atmosphere B-neutral
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It O
took O
100 O
years O
for O
Parisi O
to O
get O
around O
to O
making O
pizza B-positive
( O
at O
least O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
they O
ever O
made O
it O
before O
this O
year O
) O
... O
but O
it O
was O
worth O
the O
wait O
. O

The O
durability B-positive
of O
the O
laptop O
will O
make O
it O
worth O
the O
money O
. O

I O
have O
NEVER O
been O

the O

the O

about O

i O
've O

the O

The O
selection B-neutral
changes O
frequently O

the O
basic B-neutral
dishes I-neutral
are O
always O
available O

We O
were O
very O
surprised O
by O
how O
good O
the O
food B-positive
was O
on O
our O
first O
visit O
here O
on O
a O
Sunday O
night O
. O

but O
now O
i O
have O
realized O
its O
a O
problem O
with O
this O
brand B-negative
. O

I O
had O
the O
mango B-positive
chicken I-positive
and O
i O
ca O
n't O
go O
on O
to O
tell O
you O
how O
delicious O
that O
was O
and O
the O
presentation B-positive
was O
beautiful O
. O

Does O
everything O
I O
need O
it O
to O
, O
has O
a O
wonderful O
battery B-positive
life I-positive
and O
I O
could O
n't O
be O
happier O
. O

Just O
go O
in O
and O
sample O
the O
greatest O
french B-positive
food I-positive
west O
of O
Daniel O
. O

The O
sushi B-positive
was O
excellent O
and O
the O
wait B-positive
staff I-positive
was O
quick O
. O

The O
only O
drawback O
is O
the O
crowded O
seating B-negative
and O
the O
slow O
service B-negative
. O

Additionally O
, O
there O
is O
barely O
a O
ventilation B-negative
system I-negative
in O
the O
computer O
, O
and O
even O
the O
simple O
activity O
of O
watching B-neutral
videos I-neutral
let O
alone O
playing B-neutral
steam I-neutral
games I-neutral
causes O
the O
laptop O
to O
get O
very O
very O
hot O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
impossible O
to O
keep O
on O
lap O

I O
have O
found O
also O
, O
it O
is O
very O
easy O
to O
be O
able O
to O
access O
wireless B-positive
internet I-positive
access I-positive
; O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O
caviar O
but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-positive
and O
crab B-positive
salad I-positive
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

But O
the O
best O
pork B-positive
souvlaki I-positive
I O
ever O
had O
is O
the O
main O
thing O
. O

The O
battery B-positive
life I-positive
has O
not O
decreased O
since O
I O
bought O
it O
, O
so O
i O
'm O
thrilled O
with O
that O
. O

The O
menu O
consisted O
of O
standard O
brassiere B-positive
food I-positive
, O
better O
then O
places O
like O
Balthazar O
etc O
. O

We O
ate O
out O
in O
the O
back B-positive
patio I-positive
, O
which O
is O
worth O
it O
as O
it O
's O
cool O
and O
the O
music B-positive
is O
hear O
well O
there O
. O

The O
hanger B-negative
steak I-negative
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-negative
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

From O
the O
moment O
we O
walked O
in O
they O
were O
more O
than O
accomodating O
even O
though O
the O
place B-negative
was O
packed O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
the O
most O
Japanese O
it O
can O
ever O
get O
. O

Unless O
you O
want O
to O
be O

with O
a O
non O
working O
power B-negative
supply I-negative
which O
you O
ca O
n't O
find O
a O
replacement O
for O
because O
they O
made O
the O

so O
small O
. O

Once O
you O
get O
past O
learning O
how O
to O
use O
the O
poorly O

you O
may O
feel O
frustrated O

if O
you O

try O

it O

The O

looks O
out O

The O

the O

were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O

The O
food B-negative
is O
terrible O
and O
overall O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
avoid O
at O
all O
costs O

They O
have O
a O
very O
good O
chicken B-positive
with I-positive
avocado I-positive

good O
tuna B-positive
as O

The O
food B-positive

We O
are O

and O
get O
the O
feeling O
the O
only O
way O
this O
place O
survives O
with O
such O
average O
food B-negative
is O
because O
most O
customers O
are O
probably O
one-time O
customer O
tourists O
. O

The O
spicy B-positive

the O

in O
my O
40 O
years O

a O

We O
ordered O
the O

grilled B-negative
branzino I-negative
, O
that O
was O
so O
infused O
with O
bone O
, O
it O
was O
difficult O
to O
eat O
. O

Decor B-positive

charming O

The O
meat B-positive

the O

a O

the O

a O

I O

This O
place B-negative

not O

the O
food B-negative
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

Service B-positive
is O
fast O
and O
friendly O

I O
did O
not O
try O
the O

but O
I O
tried O
their O
salmon B-positive
and O
crab B-positive
salad I-positive
( O
they O
are O
all O
good O
) O

The O
next O
time O

Their O
tuna B-positive

appetizer I-positive

to O

It O

a O
great O

The O
place B-positive

Saul B-positive

I O
have O
never O
before O
eaten O
40 O
pieces O
of O
relatively O
good O
nigiri B-neutral
. O

The O
appetizer B-positive
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
the O
Creme B-positive
Brulee I-positive
was O
very O
savory O
and O
delicious O
. O

I O
regret O
buying O
it O
before O
understanding O
how O
awful O
it O
is O
to O
use B-negative
. O

Food B-neutral
wise O
, O
its O
ok O
but O
a O
bit O
pricey O
for O
what O
you O
get O
considering O
the O
restaurant B-neutral
is O
n't O
a O
fancy O
place O
. O

An O
unpretentious O
spot B-positive
in O
Park O
Slope O
, O
the O
sushi B-positive
is O
consistently O
good O
, O
the O
service B-positive
is O
pleasant O

effective O

unassuming O

and O
the O
owner B-positive

simply O
lovely O

some O
great O
Indian B-positive

, O
definitely O
visit O
Curry O

. O

The O
ambience B-positive
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O

so O
a O
casual O
lunch B-positive
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
good O
, O
especially O
their O
more O
basic B-positive
dishes I-positive
, O
and O
the O

Ease O

The O
kitchen B-negative
however O
, O
is O
almost O

slow O

Always O
good O
drinks B-positive
and O
service B-positive
is O
pretty O
good O

at O
night O

but O
it O
's O
hard O
to O
hear O
your O
own O
conversation O
with O
everyone O
else O
competing O
for O
that O
same O
luxury O
- O
the O
music B-negative
playing O

also O
voluminous O

I O
recommend O
this O

to O
everyone O

Who O
has O
room O
for O
Cheesesticks O
with O
the O
best O

Food B-positive
- O
awesome O

The O
dosas B-negative
are O
skimpy O

unattractive O

drip O
with O

and O
personally O
I O
'd O
drink O
popcorn O

another O
one O

some O
the O

a O

We O
were O
wondering O
why O
they O
were O
there O
to O
make O
our O
dining B-negative
experience I-negative
miserable O
? O

The O
food B-positive
there O
is O
so O

that O
the O

My O

devoured O
her O

You O
wo O

have O
to O
spend O
gobs O

on O
some O
inefficient O
virus B-negative
program I-negative
that O
needs O
to O
be O
updated O
every O
month O
and O
that O
constantly O
drains O
your O
wallet O
. O

We O
ordered O
lamb B-positive
which O
was O
perfectly O
cooked O
and O
tasted O
awesome O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
was O
pretty O
nice O
but O
had O
a O
bit O
lacking O

which O
it O
tries O
to O
make O
up O

with O
a O
crazy O
scheme B-negative
of I-negative
mirrors I-negative

Raymond B-positive
the O

rocks O

The O
screen B-positive

bright O

vivid O

the O

is O
very O
easy O
to O
use O
, O
very O
important O
for O

quick O
typers O

Turned O
out O
there O

upstairs O

I O
'm O
having O
the O
laptop O
returned O
unrepaired O
since O
paying O
$ O
176 O
every O
3 O
months O
just O
is O
n't O
worth O
it O
( O
that O
's O
about O
how O
long O
the O
port B-negative
seems O
to O
last O
) O
. O

Fish B-positive
is O
so O
very O
fresh O
. O

While O
they O
keep O
the O
capex O
to O
a O
minimum O
, O
they O
do O
put O
some O
cash O
into O
the O
bagels B-neutral
, O
because O
they O
among O
the O
best O
in O
the O
city O
. O

The O
design B-positive
is O
very O
intimate O
and O
romantic O
. O

We O
have O
been O
to O
this O
place O
many O
times O
, O
and O
always O
have O
great O
food B-positive
, O
wine B-positive
, O
and O
service B-positive

While O
the O
food B-positive
was O
good O
( O
certainly O
no O
Il O
Mulino O
) O
the O
service B-negative
was O
horrendous O
. O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-positive
was O
great O
! O

The O
nicest O
part O
is O
the O
low O
heat B-positive
output I-positive
and O
ultra O
quiet O
operation B-positive
. O

Quite O
frankly O
, O
this O
is O
some O
of O
the O
worst O
sushi B-negative
I O
have O
ever O
tried O
. O

Quality B-positive
Display I-positive
I O
was O
surprised O

Great O

I O
absolutely O
Loved O
this O
place B-positive

Service B-negative
was O
slow O
, O
but O
the O
people B-positive
were O
friendly O
. O

iLife B-positive
is O
easily O
compatible O
with O
Microsoft O
Office O
so O
you O
can O
send O
and O
receive O
files O
from O
a O
PC O
. O

Definitely O
a O
great O
spot B-positive
for O
a O
nice O
occasion O
or O
date O
. O

It O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-positive

I O
come O
from O
a O
family O
of O
pizzeria O
owners O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
almost O
ashamed O
to O
say O
that O
the O
pizza B-positive
in O
Fornino O
's O
blows O
my O
families O
receipies O
away O
. O

As O
always O
we O
had O
a O
great O
glass B-positive
of I-positive
wine I-positive
while O
we O
waited O
. O

Seating B-neutral
is O
ok O
even O
though O
sometimes O
there O
's O
alot O
of O
people O
. O

The O
lava B-positive
cake I-positive
dessert I-positive
was O
incredible O
and O
I O
recommend O
it O
. O

After O
talking O
it O
over O
with O
the O
very O
knowledgeable O
sales B-positive
associate I-positive
, O
I O
chose O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
over O
the O
white O
MacBook O
. O

best O
honey B-positive
walnyt I-positive
prawns I-positive
that O
we O
have O
every O
tasted O
. O

I O
was O
originally O
concerned O
that O
I O
could O
n't O
view O
work O
I O
had O
done O
in O
college O
on O
my O
Mac O
because O
of O
the O
PC O
formatting O
, O
but O
I O
was O
even O
more O
thrilled O
to O
learn O
of O
programs B-positive
like O
iLife B-positive
and O
iWork B-positive
that O
allow O
you O
to O
convert O
your O
PC O
documents O
into O
readable O
files O
on O
Macs O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
use O
fancy O
ingredients B-positive
, O
but O
even O
fancy O
ingredients O
do O
n't O
make O
for O
good O
pizza B-negative
unless O
someone O
knows O
how O
to O
get O
the O
crust O
right O
. O

Nice O
screen B-positive
, O
keyboard B-positive
works O
great O
! O

After O
really O
enjoying O
ourselves O
at O
the O
bar B-positive
we O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
table O
and O
had O
dinner O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-negative
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

It O
's O
graphics B-neutral
are O
n't O
bad O
at O
all O
, O
for O
the O
lower O
end O
of O
the O
MacBook O
Pro O
spectrum O
, O
easily O
capable O
of O
running O
StarCraft O
II O
and O
other O
games O
with O
comparable O
graphics O
. O

However O
, O
the O
value O
and O
service B-negative
are O
both O
severely O
lacking O
. O

Screen B-positive
is O
bright O
and O
gorgeous O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut O
special O
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak O
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
top-notch O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
little O
place B-positive
with O
tons O
of O
potential O
to O
be O
a O
neighborhood O
joint O
if O
the O
service O
were O
n't O
so O
impersonal O
and O
corporate-like O
. O

Its O
very O
nice O
and O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
features B-neutral
you O
will O
be O
so O
happy O
to O
have O
such O
a O
sophisticated O
computer O
. O

I O
had O
a O
late O
dinner B-neutral
at O
Lucky O
Stike O
, O
a O
great O
name O
for O
a O
joint O
if O
ever O
I O
saw O
one O
. O

Bison B-positive
was O
quite O
excellent O
however O
. O

i O
would O
normally O
not O
finish O
the O
brocolli O
when O
i O
order O
these O
kinds O
of O
food O
but O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
every O
piece O
was O
as O
eventful O
as O
the O
first O
one O
... O
the O
scallops B-positive
and O
prawns B-positive
was O
so O
fresh O
and O
nicely O
cooked O
. O

For O
authentic O
Thai B-positive
food I-positive

look O
no O
further O

With O
so O
many O
good O
restaurants O
on O
the O
UWS O

I O
do O
n't O
need O
overpriced O

absurdly O
arrogant O

who O
do O
n't O
recognize O
they O
work O
at O
a O
glorified O
diner B-negative

clumsy O
service B-negative

and O
management B-negative
that O
does O

Yes O
, O
a O
Mac O
is O
much O
more O
money O
than O
the O

out O
there O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
comparison O
in O
style B-positive
, O
speed B-positive
and O
just O
cool O
factor O

The O
service B-positive
was O
impeccable O

unobtrusive O

the O
staff O
knows O
what O
they O
are O
there O

to O
know O
their O

present O
your O

My O
friend O

also O
the O
complete O
opposite O
of O

The O

Just O

I O
like O
the O
somosas B-positive

the O

at O
taj O

vegetarians O

rejoice-all O

The O

we O

the O

very O
good O
, O
did O
n't O
much O
like O
the O

that O
came O
with O

but O
the O
filet O
was O
so O
good O
, O
neither O

Their O

horrific O

sometimes O
you O
will O
be O
moving O
your O

the O

will O
not O
even O

Apparently O
under O
the O

there O
are O
2 O
little O
screws O

when O
the O

gets O
moved O
back O

What O
an O
amazing O
meal B-positive
and O
experience O
! O

The O
crust B-positive
has O
a O
great O
bite O
and O
a O
good O
chew O
, O
the O
sauce B-positive
is O
light O
with O
a O
nice O
acidity O
to O
it O
, O
the O
salt O
from O
the O
cheese B-positive
is O
great O
, O
really O
heightens O
the O
flavor O
of O
all O
the O
other O

. O

Service B-positive
here O
was O
great O
, O
food B-positive
was O
fantastic O

very O
good O

as O
well O
. O

The O
decor B-neutral
in O
this O
place O
is O
very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place O
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O
, O
small O
and O
sparse O
. O

Chintzy O
portions B-negative

I O
took O
off O
a O
star O
because O
the O
machine O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
junk O
software B-negative
on O
it O
. O

It O
is O
much O
faster O
than O
my O

is O
a O
Core2 B-neutral

Outstanding O
Bagels B-positive
, O
but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O
. O

It O
was O
n't O
the O
freshest O
seafood B-neutral
ever O
, O
but O
the O
taste O
and O
presentation O
was O
OK O
. O

My O
boyfriend O
had O
the O
New B-positive
England I-positive
Chowder I-positive
it O
was O
good O
but O
I O
think O
the O
award O
should O
go O
to O
the O
Lobster B-positive
Bisque I-positive
. O

This O
tiny O
restaurant B-positive
is O
as O
cozy O
as O
it O
gets O
, O
with O
that O
certain O
Parisian O
flair O
. O

A O
cheaper O
price B-positive
should O
not O
equal O
a O
`` O
cheap O
'' O
product O
. O

My O
only O
complaint O
might O
be O
the O
fortune B-negative
cookies I-negative
- O
I O
've O
never O
had O
a O
cookie O
predict O
bad O
luck O
for O
me O
before O
I O
visited O

What O
is O
even O
better O
, O
is O
that O
the O
prices B-positive
are O
very O
affordable O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
really O
good O

of I-positive
thin I-positive

pizza I-positive
including O
the O

The O
sangria B-positive
was O
pretty O
tasty O
and O
good O
on O
a O
hot O
muggy O
day O
. O

Although O
i O
do O
believe O
that O
Windows B-negative
operating I-negative
system I-negative
may O
be O
to O
fault O
for O
some O
of O
the O

Lucky B-positive
Strike I-positive
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place O
to O
just O
grab O
a O

to O
eat O
. O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-positive
and I-positive
Cypriot I-positive
dishes I-positive
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro O
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
-- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O

wasted O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O

The O

nice O
-- O
also O
you O
can O
just O
get O
counter O

sit O
. O

The O
decor B-negative
is O
really O
blah O
, O
and O
not O
at O
all O
hip O
or O
happening O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
good O
and O
ambience B-positive
is O
good O
for O
a O
date O
or O
group O
outing O
. O

Waiters B-positive
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
the O
pasta B-positive

out O

It O

it O

Nice O

with O
classic O

The O

life I-positive
seems O
to O
be O
very O
good O
, O
and O
have O
had O
no O

Luckily O

saved O
room O
for O
the O
BBQ B-positive
Salmon I-positive
, O
Sea B-positive
Bass I-positive
and O
Crispy B-positive
Duck I-positive

The O
falafal B-negative
was O
rather O
over O
cooked O
and O
dried O
but O
the O
chicken B-positive
was O
fine O
. O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O
- O
and O
the O
staff B-negative
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O

they O
were O
very O
rude O

The O
food B-positive
, O
served O
in O
small O
tasting O
portions B-positive
( O
as O
an O
option O
) O
is O
very O
good O
with O
each O
dish B-positive
being O
better O
than O
the O
next O
. O

This O
is O
the O
MOST O
wonderful O
restaurant B-positive
in O
all O
of O
New O
York O
City O
, O
not O
just O
Brooklyn O
... O

The O
place B-positive
is O
so O
cool O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
prompt O
and O
curtious O
. O

The O
fish B-negative
was O
adequate O
, O
but O
inexpertly O
sliced O
. O

It O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O
impress O
someone O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
pretty O
good O
. O

The O
battery B-negative
never O
held O
a O
charge B-negative
longer O
than O
one O
hour O
and O
within O
two O
months O
, O
stopped O
holding O
a O
charge B-negative
for O
more O
than O
ten O
minutes O
. O

i O
've O
been O
to O
sapphire O
twice O
and O
both O
times O
the O
food B-positive
was O
fine O
, O
if O
not O
good O
. O

Yum O
, O
the O
chicken B-positive
is O
great O
here O
. O

I O
'd O
highly O
recommend O
it O
for O
a O
special O
occasion O
-- O
it O
provides O
and O
intimate O
setting B-positive
and O
nice O
service B-positive
. O

But O
the O
main O
hit O
was O
the O
whole B-positive
grilled I-positive
fish I-positive
. O

The O
prices B-positive
are O
exceptionally O
reasonable O
for O
food O
of O
this O
caliber O
. O

We O
also O
ordered O
two O
hot B-neutral
dogs I-neutral
thinking O
they O
would O
be O
pretty O
good O
since O
there O
is O
a O
whole O
section O
on O
the O
menu O
devoted O
to O
them O
. O

The O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
is O
extensive O
and O
impressive O
. O

Succulent O
steaks B-positive
cooked O
precisely O
to O
your O
desired O
'doneness O
' O
accompanied O
by O
salads O
and O
sides O
that O
do O
n't O
look O
like O
leafy O

Desserts B-positive
are O
almost O
incredible O
: O
my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
their O
Tart B-positive
of I-positive
the I-positive
Day I-positive
. O

But O
, O
for O
the O
cost B-positive
this O
is O
a O
winner O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Scalina O
Fedeli O
reminded O
me O
why O
service B-positive
is O
so O
integral O
to O
fine O
dining B-positive
. O

I O
also O
wanted O
Windows B-positive
7 I-positive
, O
which O
this O
one O
has O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-positive
is O
even O
better O
. O

Very O
good O
service B-positive
and O
very O
good O
prices B-positive
. O

The O
price O
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-negative
is O
poor O
. O

Plus O
two B-positive
finger I-positive
clicking I-positive
as O
a O
replacement O
for O
the O
right B-neutral
click I-neutral
button I-neutral
is O
surprisingly O
intuitive O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
amazing O
! O
! O

It O
is O
n't O
the O
cheapest O
sushi B-positive
but O
has O
been O
worth O
it O
every O
time O
. O

The O
body B-negative
is O
a O
bit O
cheaply O
made O
so O
it O
will O
be O
interesting O
to O
see O
how O
long O
it O
holds O
up O
. O

The O
food B-positive
's O
as O
good O
as O
ever O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
fresh B-positive
tomato I-positive
sauce I-positive

mozz I-positive
cheese I-positive
, O
basil O
and O
the O

makes O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
pizza B-positive

in O
NY O
. O

The O
food B-negative
was O
not O
fresh O
, O
the O
sauces B-negative
were O
bland O

very O
oily O
. O

I O
continued O
to O

again O

not O
the O
greatest O

worth O
the O

) O
and O
the O
lamb B-positive
vindaloo I-positive
is O
great O

Everyone O
that O
sat O
in O
the O
back O
outside O
agreed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
worst O
service B-negative
we O
had O
ever O
received O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-positive
in O
NYC O
. O

The O
design B-positive
is O
awesome O
, O
quality B-positive
is O
unprecedented O
. O

Even O
for O
two O
very O
hungry O
people O
there O
is O
plenty O
of O
food B-positive
left O
to O
be O
taken O
home O
( O
it O
reheats O
really O
well O
also O
) O
. O

The O
steak B-negative
was O
very O
fatty O
and O
the O
sauce B-negative
was O
overpowering O
and O
not O
very O
tasty O
. O

The O
Pad B-positive
Thai I-positive
is O
excellent O
here O
, O
as O
well O
. O

This O
is O
a O
consistently O
great O
place O
to O
dine B-positive
for O
lunch O
or O
dinner O
. O

The O
screen B-positive
is O
gorgeous O
- O
yummy O
good O

Very O
good O

and O
well O
made O

Besides O
, O
when O
you O
have O
bad O
service B-negative
, O
that O
's O
less O
money B-negative
you O
have O
to O
tip B-negative
. O

They O
claim O
call B-negative
center I-negative
is O
still O
down O
. O

The O
bagel B-neutral
was O
huge O
. O

I O
love O
the O
drinks B-positive
, O
esp O
lychee B-positive
martini I-positive
, O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
also O
VERY O
good O
. O

All O
we O
received O
was O
an O
apology O
as O
we O
left O
to O
see O
our O
show O
without O
dinner B-neutral
. O

We O
recently O
spent O
New O
Year O

Eve O
at O
the O

and O
had O
a O
great O
experience O
, O
from O
the O
wine B-positive
to O
the O
dessert B-positive
menu I-positive
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Atmosphere B-negative
is O
a O
bore O
. O

Besides O
the O
great O
look B-positive
, O
it O
is O
a O
great O
machine O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
very O
good O
- O
prompt O
, O
attentive O
and O
non-intrusive O
. O

The O
ambience B-positive
is O
very O
romantic O
and O
definitely O
a O
good O
place B-positive
to O
bring O
a O
date O
. O

The O
restaurant O
has O
a O
Family O
feel O
, O
not O
least O
with O
regard O
to O
the O
portions B-positive
which O
are O
enormous O
; O
the O
veal O
alone O
could O
have O
single-handedly O
solved O
third O

famine O
. O

Delivery B-positive
is O
fast O
too O
. O

It O
's O
not O
inexpensive O
but O
the O
Hardware B-positive
performance I-positive
is O
impressive O
for O
a O
computer O
this O
small O
. O

Someone O
else O
recommended O
the O
dessert B-negative
- O
we O
also O
left O
that O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters O
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

I O
like O
how O
the O
Mac B-positive
OS I-positive
is O
so O
simple O
and O
easy O
to O
use B-positive
. O

It O
's O
boring O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
and O
our O
sushi B-negative
was O
pretty O
below O
average O
... O
the O
tuna B-negative
was O
soggy O
and O
the O
other O
rolls B-negative
had O
no O

instead O
, O
they O
have O
amazing O
food B-positive
and O
the O
BEST O
service B-positive

The O
quail B-positive
was O
fantastic O
and O
unique O
and O
the O
pastas B-positive
were O
full O
of O
flavor B-positive
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
attentive O
. O

The O
real O
problem O
I O
had O
with O
this O
place O
was O
the O
complete O
lack O
of O
service B-negative
. O

I O
finally O
decided O
on O
this O
laptop O
because O
it O
was O
the O
right O
price B-positive
for O
what O
I O
need O
it O
. O

I O
really O
liked O
this O

I O
'm O
glad O
I O
was O
introduced O
to O
this O
place B-positive

this O
is O
a O
rare O
gem O
in O
NY O

It O

I O
did O

I O
love O
the O

This O
place B-neutral
is O
always O

I O
work O
near-by O

and O
they O
have O
the O
BEST O
oatmeal B-positive

not O
a O

or O
quick-cooked O
item O
. O

Good O

Very O
`` O

My O

had O
a O
great O
time O

i O
love O
the O

The O
pizza B-positive
was O
great O
. O

At O
best O
, O
the O
food B-negative
was O
good O
and O
definately O
overpriced O
. O

Yes O
, O
they O
're O
a O
bit O
more O
expensive O
then O
typical O
, O
but O
then O
again O
, O
so O
is O
their O
food B-positive
. O

But O
the O
biggest O
pain O
is O
that O
tech B-negative
support I-negative
is O
not O
available O
24/7 O

The O

the O

I O
tried O

I O
guess O
the O
only O

out O

these O

the O

the O

the O

I O
liked O

in O
the O
Try-State O
Area O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
it O
just O
because O
of O
the O
internet B-positive
speed I-positive
probably O
because O
thats O
the O
only O
thing O
i O
really O
care O
about O
. O

Food B-positive
was O
good O
and O
the O
view B-positive
of I-positive
the I-positive
new I-positive
york I-positive
city I-positive
skiline I-positive
was O
terrific O
even O
on O
a O
foggy O
rainy O
day O
like O
that O
of O
when O
I O
went O
. O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
sushi B-positive
in O
the O
city O
. O

Wine B-positive
list I-positive
selection I-positive
is O
good O
and O
wine-by-the-glass B-positive
was O
generously O
filled O
to O
the O
top O
. O

The O
resolution B-positive
is O
even O
higher O
then O
any O
other O
laptop O
on O
the O
market O
. O

Anyways O
, O
if O
you O
're O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
to O
eat O
good O
food B-positive
, O
I O
would O
n't O
waste O
my O
time O
trying O
to O
find O
something O
, O
rather O
go O
across O
the O
street O
to O
Tamari O
. O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
dining B-negative
experience I-negative
I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

Also O
the O
speakers B-negative
are O
not O
very O
loud O
, O
But O
it O
is O
a O
netbook O
. O

In O
early O
May O
I O
got O
it O
back O
and O
this O
time O
I O
only O
had O
it O
back O
for O
1 O
day O
before O
it O
had O
a O
NEW O
issue O
so O
it O
was O
sent O
back O
in O
for O
the O
6th O
time O
they O
`` O
expedited O
'' O
the O
repairs O
so O
I O
was O
only O
supposed O
to O
have O
to O
be O
without O
it O
for O
3 O
days O
and O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
fixed O
, O
by O
a O
`` O
Senior B-negative
Tech I-negative
'' O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Casimir B-positive
over O
5 O
times O
and O
I O
have O
always O
had O
a O
great O
time O
there O
. O

There O
are O
no O
gold O
key O
numbers O
too O
intall O
programs B-negative
, O
you O
must O
use O
the O
serial O
numbers O
that O
it O
does O
not O
accept O
and O
then O
things O
are O
limited O
as O
far O
a O
working O
because O
they O
are O
only O
good O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O

Really O
like O
the O
textured O
surface B-positive
which O
shows O
no O
fingerprints O
. O

Since O
it O
literally O
is O
a O
complete O
hole O
in O
the O
wall O
, O
it O
's O
a O
bit O
intimidating O
at O
first O
, O
but O
you O
get O
over O
that O
very O
quickly O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
friendly O
staff B-positive
welcomes O
you O
- O
do O
n't O
hesitate O
to O
ask O
for O
help O
with O
what O
to O
get O
. O

The O
2 B-positive
GB I-positive
of I-positive
RAM I-positive
is O
plenty O
, O
able O
to O
run O
Windows B-positive
7 I-positive
and O
at O
least O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O
programs B-positive
with O
next O
to O
no O
slowdown O
. O

The O
Thali B-negative
was O
small O
, O
thoroughly O
unremarkable O
, O
and O
$ O
14.95 O
. O

Admittedly O
some O
nights O
inside O
the O
restaurant B-negative
were O
rather O
warm O
, O
but O
the O
open B-positive
kitchen I-positive
is O
part O
of O
the O
charm O
. O

super O
fast O
processor B-positive
and O
really O
nice O
graphics B-positive
card I-positive
... O

I O
recommend O
the O
black B-positive
roasted I-positive
codfish I-positive
, O
it O
was O
the O
best O
dish B-positive
of O
the O
evening O
. O

While O
the O
ambiance B-positive
and O
atmosphere B-positive
were O
great O
, O
the O
food B-negative
and O
service B-negative
could O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

Best O
Pastrami B-positive
I O
ever O
had O
and O
great O
portion B-positive
without O
being O
ridiculous O
. O

Check O
out O
the O
secret B-positive
back I-positive
room I-positive
. O

Great O
Hot B-positive
Dogs I-positive
! O

To O
be O
completely O
fair O
, O
the O
only O
redeeming O
factor O
was O
the O
food B-positive
, O
which O
was O
above O
average O
, O
but O
could O
n't O
make O
up O
for O
all O
the O
other O
deficiencies O
of O
Teodora B-negative
. O

Keys B-negative
stick O
periodically O
and O
I O
havent O
had O
the O
laptop O
for O
45 O
days O
yet O
. O

A O
coworker O
and O
I O
tried O
Pacifico B-positive
after O
work O
a O
few O
Fridays O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

fresh B-positive
restaurant I-positive
was O
amazing O
... O
... O
.. O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
of O
course O
fresh O
. O

The O
dishes B-positive
offered O
were O
unique O
, O
very O
tasty O
and O
fresh O
from O
the O
lamb O
sausages O
, O
sardines O
with O
biscuits O
, O
large O
whole O
shrimp O
to O
the O
amazing O
pistachio B-positive
ice I-positive
cream I-positive
( O
the O
best O
and O
freshest O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
) O
. O

The O
noodle B-positive
and I-positive
rices I-positive
dishes I-positive
taste O
great O
. O

It O
's O
also O
attached O
to O
Angel O
's O
Share O
, O
which O
is O
a O
cool O
, O
more O
romantic O
bar B-positive
... O

Acceptable O
prices B-positive
. O

The O
Prix B-positive
Fixe I-positive
menu I-positive
is O
worth O
every O
penny O
and O
you O
get O
more O
than O
enough O
( O
both O
in O
quantity O
AND O
quality O
) O
. O

Lucky O
Strike O
is O
a O
great O
casual O
place B-positive
to O
just O
grab O
a O
bite O
to O
eat O
. O

It O
is O
not O
ideal O
for O
children O
because O
of O
the O
temp B-negative
. O

It O
was O
also O
suffering O
from O
hardware B-negative
( I-negative
keyboard I-negative
) I-negative
issues O
, O
relatively O
slow O
performance B-negative
and O
shortening O
battery B-negative
lifetime I-negative
. O

Certainly O
not O
the O
best O
sushi O
in O
New O
York O
, O
however O
, O
it O
is O
always O
fresh O
, O
and O
the O
place B-positive
is O
very O
clean O
, O
sterile O
. O

I O
use O
it O
mostly O
for O
content O
creation O
( O
Audio B-positive
, O
video B-positive
, O
photo B-positive
editing I-positive
) O
and O
its O
reliable O
. O

I O
took O
one O
look O
at O
the O
chicken B-negative
and O
I O
was O
appalled O
. O

Then O
after O
paying O
for O
it O
to O
be O
examined O
I O
was O
told O
it O
was O
same O
problem O
cited O
on O
website O
but O
I O
'd O
have O
to O
pay O
anyways O
since O
it O
was O
past O
warrenty B-negative
. O

My O
favs O
here O
are O
the O
Tacos B-positive
Pastor I-positive
and O
the O
Tostada B-positive
de I-positive
Tinga I-positive
... O

I O
take O
it O
everywhere O
with O
me O
because O
it O
's O
so O
easy O
to O
carry B-positive
. O

A O
longer O
battery O
life O
would O
have O
been O
great O
- O
but O
it O
meets O
it O
's O
spec B-positive
quite O
easily O
. O

They O
need O
a O
kick O
out O
of O
it O
but O
until O
then O
the O
sushi B-positive
is O
pretty O
good O
and O
the O
place B-positive
is O
consistent O
. O

The O
place B-negative
was O
real O
empty O
but O
that O
was O
because O
this O
was O
the O
first O
Sunday O
they O
ever O
opened O
. O

the O
turkey B-negative
burgers I-negative
are O
scary O
! O

The O
only O
objection O
I O
have O
is O
that O
after O
you O
buy O
it O
the O
windows B-negative
7 I-negative
system I-negative
is O
a O
starter O
and O
charges O
for O
the O
upgrade O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
amazing O
, O
the O
service B-positive
was O
so O
attentive O
and O
personable O
, O
and O
how O
about O
that O
ambience O
! O

Also O
, O
if O
you O
need O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
representive O
at O
Microsoft O
, O
there O
is O
a O
charge O
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
robbery O
, O
since O
you O
are O
charged O
enormous O
amounts O
for O
a O
very O
badly O
designed O
system B-negative
, O
which O
most O
people O
would O
have O
went O
with O
XP O
if O
they O
could O
. O

Their O
bagels B-negative
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

The O
sound B-positive
is O
nice O
and O
loud O
; O
I O
do O
n't O
have O
any O
problems O
with O
hearing O
anything O
. O

The O
Management B-negative
was O
less O
than O
accomodating O
. O

The O
food B-negative
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-positive
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-positive
food I-positive
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
only O
fallback O
on O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
prices B-negative
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-positive
. O

I O
know O
some O
people O
complained O
about O
HDMI B-neutral
issues O
but O
they O
released O
a O
firmware O
patch O
to O
address O
that O
issue O
. O

The O
seafood B-positive
is O
amazing O
, O
there O
's O
a O
good O
wine B-positive
list I-positive
, O
and O
the O
ever-changing O
menu B-positive
always O
offers O
some O
great O
surprises O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
average O
to O
above-average O
; O
the O
French B-positive
Onion I-positive
soup I-positive
filling O
yet O
not O
overly O
impressive O
, O
and O
the O
desserts B-negative
not O
brilliant O
in O
any O
way O
. O

It O
is O
super O
fast O
and O
has O
outstanding O
graphics B-positive
. O

It O
's O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
navigate B-positive
through O
the O
operating B-positive
system I-positive
, O
to O
find B-positive
files I-positive
, O
and O
it O
runs B-positive
a O
lot O
faster O
! O

Service B-positive
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

Great O
wifi B-positive
too O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
tasty O
and O
portion B-positive
sizes I-positive
are O
appropriate O
. O

The O
ATI B-positive
graphics I-positive
card I-positive
is O
a O
huge O
plus O
, O
definitely O
a O
good O
value O
if O
you O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
run O
some O
slightly O
older O
games B-neutral
that O
a O
Intel B-positive
built-in I-positive
card I-positive
would O
have O
trouble O
with O
, O
such O
as O
Half-Life O
2 O
or O
even O
World O
of O
Warcraft O
. O

An O
excellent O
service B-positive

This O
place B-positive
is O
always O
very O
crowded O
and O
popular O
. O

The O
food B-negative
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

They O
have O
authentic O
Indian B-positive
at O
amazin O
prices O
. O

The O
lone O
argentine O
chorizo O
appetizer O
at O

8.95 O
was O
a O
heavy O
fennel B-negative
flavored I-negative
Italian I-negative
sausage I-negative
like O
the O
ones O
that O
sell O
for O
$ O
2.99/lb O
at O
the O

Anyway O
, O
the O
owner B-negative
was O
fake O

my O
picks O
are O
: O

Scallion B-positive
Pancake I-positive
( O

, O
I O
would O
n't O
recommend O
to O
my O
American O
friends O
as O
it O
's O
very O
spicy O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B-positive
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O
but O
really O
delicious O
. O

They O
did O
not O
have O
mayonnaise O
, O
forgot O
our O
toast B-negative
, O
left O
out O
ingredients B-negative
( O
ie O
cheese B-neutral
in O
an O
omelet B-neutral
) O
, O
below O
hot O
temperatures O
and O
the O
bacon B-negative
was O
so O
over O
cooked O
it O
crumbled O
on O
the O
plate B-neutral
when O
you O
touched O
it O

Hard O

space I-positive
( O
500GB O

Nice O

There O

I O
ca O

about O

brown O

who O
eavesdrops O
on O
your O

chimes O
in O
- O
except O
she O
only O
hears O
the O
last O
part O
of O
what O
you O
said O
, O
so O
her O
uninvited O
opinions O
are O
often O
out O
of O
context O
and O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
you O
're O
*really* O
talking O
about O

The O

outrageously O
good O

The O
menu B-negative
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

It O
has O
a O
10 O

when O
you O

it O

have O
a O

The O
only O
problem O

that O
the O

warm O

during O

about O
the O

to O
figure O
out O
if O
you O
are O
familiar O
with O
Microsoft B-neutral
Windows I-neutral

Not O
easy O
to O

the O
price O
ca O
n't O

The O

took O
a O
little O
bit O
away O
from O
the O

gray O
one O
which O
looked O
really O
slick O
, O
but O
it O

still O
a O
great O
notebook O

I O
liked O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
very O
much O

the O
food B-negative

not O
worth O
the O

The O

The O

is O
Well O
worth O
it O
superb O
food B-positive
. O

The O
Mac O
mini O
is O
about O
8x O
smaller O
than O
my O
old O
computer O
which O
is O
a O
huge O
bonus O
and O
runs B-positive
very O
quiet O
, O
actually O
the O
fans B-positive
are O
n't O
audible O
unlike O
my O
old O
pc O

I O
would O
highly O
recommend O
this O
place B-positive
! O

good O
place B-positive
to O
hang O
out O
during O
the O
day O
after O
shopping O
or O
to O
grab O
a O
simple O
soup B-neutral
or O
classic O
french B-neutral
dish I-neutral
over O
a O
glass O
of O
wine O
. O

Service B-positive
has O
always O
been O
friendly O
and O
efficient O
. O

The O
right B-negative
speaker I-negative
did O
not O
work O
. O

The O
main B-positive
entree I-positive
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

If O
you O
want O
good O
authentic O
Thai B-negative
this O
place O
is O
not O
the O
place O
to O
go O
. O

But O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
the O
compatibility B-negative
issues O
and O
the O
other O
little O
quirks O
make O
me O
think O
I O
ll O
buy O
a O
PC O
next O
time O
. O

Apparently O
well O
-- O
built B-positive
and O
gorgeous O
to O
look B-positive
at O
, O
the O
i5 O
MacBook O
Pro O
is O
a O
winning O
combination O
of O
price B-positive
and O
performance B-positive
. O

The O
hanger B-negative
steak I-negative
was O
like O
rubber O
and O
the O
tuna B-negative
was O
flavorless O
not O
to O
mention O
it O
tasted O
like O
it O
had O
just O
been O
thawed O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
, O
the O
coffee B-positive
was O
good O
even O
by O
starbucks O
standards O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
outstanding O
. O

Garageband B-neutral
is O
more O
for O
the O
musicians O
, O
and O
the O
laptop O
is O
equipped O
with O
a O
good O
working O
microphone B-positive
, O
good O
enough O
for O
beginners O
and O
musicians O
at O
the O
intermediate O
level O
. O

The O
best O
calamari B-positive
in O
Seattle O
! O

The O
chicken B-positive
dinner I-positive
was O
real O
good O
. O

Worse O
, O
for O
the O
price B-negative
I O
could O
get O
a O
*netbook* O
that O
outperforms O
this O
machine O
. O

After O
dinner O
, O
take O
your O
date O
to O
the O
HUGE O
dance B-positive
floor I-positive
, O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
you O
'll O
see O
in O
NY O
. O

The O
mussles B-negative
were O
the O
fishiest O
things O
I O
've O
ever O
tasted O
, O
the O
seabass B-negative
was O
bland O
, O
the O
goat B-negative
cheese I-negative
salad I-negative
was O
missing O
the O
goat O
cheese O
, O
the O
penne B-negative
w/ I-negative
chicken I-negative
had O
bones O
in O
it O
... O
It O
was O
disgusting O
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
better O
Indian B-positive
food I-positive
in O
all O
of O
the O
city O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
is O
yummy O
and O
I O
like O
the O
atmoshpere B-positive
. O

But O
guess O
what O
? O
( O
you O
have O
to O
buy O
an O
external B-negative
dvd I-negative
drive I-negative
it O
does O
n't O
have O
a O
built O
in O
type O
) O
The O
notebook O
ca O
n't O
be O
used O
because O
it O
does O
n't O
read O
anything O
for O
an O
external B-negative
drive I-negative
. O

I O
really O
recommend O
the O
very O
simple O
Unda B-positive
( I-positive
Egg I-positive
) I-positive
rolls I-positive
. O

I O
do O
not O
recommend O
lunch B-negative
specials I-negative
just O
because O
it O
tasts O
the O
same O
with O
other O
regular O
chinese O
restaurant O
. O

Kind O
of O
a O
small O
place B-neutral
but O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
are O
not O
too O
busy O
might O
be O
able O
to O
fit O
a O
group O
or O
kids O
. O

The O
portion B-positive
sizes I-positive
here O
are O
huge O
, O
and O
the O
sushi B-positive
is O
good O
. O

good O
food B-positive
good O
wine B-positive
that O
's O
it O
. O

The O
setting B-positive
is O
casual O
and O
romantic O
. O

The O
pastas B-positive
are O
incredible O
, O
the O
risottos B-positive
( O
particularly O
the O
sepia B-positive
) O
are O
fantastic O
and O
the O
braised B-positive
rabbit I-positive
is O
amazing O
. O

I O
'm O
still O
mad O
that O
i O
had O
to O
pay O
for O
lousy O
food B-negative
. O

Service B-neutral
is O
average O
. O

First O
went O
here O
to O
enjoy O
their O
garden B-positive
terrace I-positive
. O

The O
ambience B-positive
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

Another O
thing O
I O
might O
add O
is O
the O
battery B-positive
life I-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
to O
look B-positive
at O
and O
the O
keys B-positive
are O
easy O
to O
type O
with O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O
dish B-negative
. O

The O
Halibut B-negative
was O
too O
salty O
, O
dessert B-neutral
was O
so O
so O
( O
do O
n't O
waste O
any O
of O
your O
calories O
) O
and O
service B-negative
was O
poor O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
( O
I O
had O
a O
halibut B-positive
special I-positive
, O
my O
husband O
had O
steak B-positive
) O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
top-notch O
. O

Sauce B-negative
was O
watery O
and O
the O
food B-negative
did O
n't O
have O
much O
flavor O
. O

skip O
dessert B-negative
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
is O
noisy O
and O
the O
waiters B-positive
are O
literally O
walking O
around O
doing O
things O
as O
fast O
as O
they O
can O
. O

Sells O
for O
the O
same O
as O
a O
netbook O
without O
sacrificing O
size B-positive
. O

I O
recommend O
this O
spot O
to O
anyone O
who O
enjoys O
fine O
cuisine B-positive
at O
reasonable O
prices B-positive
. O

The O
portions B-neutral
are O
HUGE O
, O
so O
it O
might O
be O
good O
to O
order O
three O
things O
to O
split O
( O
rather O
than O
one O
appetizer O
and O
entree O
per O
person O
) O
for O
two O
people O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
even O
have O
complained O
at O
all O
if O
the O
food O
at O
least O
tasted O
good O
but O
the O
quality B-negative
of I-negative
food I-negative
was O
crappy O
, O
too O
. O

The O
Sashimi B-positive
portion I-positive
are O
big O
enough O
to O
appease O
most O
people O
, O
but O
I O
did O
n't O
like O
the O
fact O
they O
used O
artifical B-negative
lobster I-negative
meat I-negative
. O

Not O
too O
expense O
and O
has O
enough O
storage B-positive
for O
most O
users O
and O
many O
ports B-positive
. O

I O
dual O
boot O
with O
Linux B-neutral
and O
that O
other O
security-prone B-neutral
OS I-neutral
and O
it O
performs B-positive
flawlessly O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
also O
very O
good O
. O

The O
keyboard B-negative
is O
too O
slick O
. O

Went O
on O
a O
3 O
day O
oyster O
binge O
, O
with O
Fish O
bringing O
up O
the O
closing O
, O
and O
I O
am O
so O
glad O
this O
was O
the O
place B-positive
it O
O O
trip O
ended O
, O
because O
it O
was O
so O
great O
! O

( O
The O
asparagus B-positive
, I-positive
truffle I-positive
oil I-positive
, I-positive
parmesan I-positive
bruschetta I-positive
is O
a O
winner O
! O
) O

The O
service B-positive
was O
superb O
, O
they O
treat O
you O
like O
family O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
all-around O
good O
, O
with O
the O
rolls B-positive
usually O
excellent O
and O
the O
sushi/sashimi O
not O
quite O
on O
the O
same O
level O
. O

Its O
a O
good O
laptop O
for O
its O
value B-positive
. O

Try O
the O
congee O
and O
the O
donut O
like O
deep O
fried O
dough O
they O
call O
Ow B-positive
Ley I-positive
Soh I-positive
, O
a O
delicious O
and O
sweet O
tasting O
bread O
. O

Our O
waiter B-positive
was O
fine O
, O
the O
place B-positive
looks O
nice O
in O
that O
not-trying-too-hard O
way O
, O
but O
at O
those O
prices O
, O
a O
little O
more O
should O
be O
expected O
of O
your O
food B-negative
. O

The O
ease O
of O
set B-positive
up I-positive
was O
terrific O
. O

I O
recommend O
the O
jelly B-positive
fish I-positive
, O
drunken B-positive
chicken I-positive
and O
the O
soupy B-positive
dumplings I-positive
, O
certainly O
the O
stir B-positive
fry I-positive
blue I-positive
crab I-positive
. O

Not O
impressed O
with O
the O
food B-negative
. O

The O
host B-positive
( I-positive
owner I-positive
) I-positive
and O
servers B-positive
are O
personable O
and O
caring O
. O

And O
evaluated O
on O
those O
terms O
Pastis B-positive
is O
simply O
wonderful O
. O

the O
salads B-positive
are O
delicious O
, O
both O
refreshing O
and O
very O
spicy O
. O

The O
manager O
came O
to O
the O
table O
and O
said O
we O
can O
do O
what O
we O
want O
, O
so O
we O
paid O
for O
what O
we O
did O
enjoy O
, O
the O
drinks B-positive
and O
appetizers B-positive
, O
and O
walked O
out O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
really O
attentive O
and O
charming O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
authentic O
. O

The O
OS B-positive
is O
great O
. O

It O
made O
the O
computer O
much O
easier O
to O
use B-positive
and O
navigate B-positive
. O

Stick O
to O
the O

the O

, O
wings B-positive
, O

I O
lOVE O
THIS O

Terrible O
service B-negative
, O
food B-neutral
ok O

In O
November O
my O
computer O
messed O
up O
entirely O
and O
would O
n't O
power O
on O
after O
intalling O
a O
Windows B-neutral
update I-neutral
, O
I O
had O
to O
have O
my O

lost O
EVERYTHING O
on O
it O
, O
including O
my O
school O
assignments O
and O
irriplaceable O
pictures O
that O
were O
only O
in O
digital O

and O
several O
other O
things O
, O
when O
this O
update O
was O
installed O
for O
some O
reason O
I O
was O
unable O
to O
roll O
back O
the O
drivers O
and O
everything O
to O
an O
earlier O
working O
condition O
because O
when O
the O
update O
was O
installed O
it O
deleted O
my O
history O
. O

Everything O
about O
this O
place O
is O
adorable O
- O
even O
the O
bathroom B-positive
! O

The O
computer O
itself O
was O
fast O
, O
ran B-positive
smoothly O
, O
and O
had O
no O
problems O
. O

Truly O
the O
mark O
of O
an O
attentive O
waiter B-positive
. O

The O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
are O
good O
, O
yes O
, O
but O
the O
reason O
to O
get O
over O
here O
is O
the O
fantastic O
pork B-positive
croquette I-positive
sandwich I-positive
, O
perfect O
on O
its O
supermarket O
squishy O
bun B-positive
. O

we O
decided O
to O
eat O
in O
tea B-positive
room I-positive
which O
was O
small O
and O
cute O
. O

The O
drinks B-positive
are O
always O
well O
made O
and O
wine B-positive
selection I-positive
is O
fairly O
priced O
. O

The O
seats B-negative
are O
uncomfortable O
if O
you O
are O
sitting O
against O
the O
wall O
on O
wooden O
benches O
. O

Vanison B-neutral
was O
good O
but O
not O
amazing O
. O

Most O
importantly O
, O
food B-positive
is O
excellent O
. O

This O
is O
the O
best O
sushi B-positive
in O
new O
york O
city O
- O
hands O
down O
. O

The O
view B-positive
is O
spectacular O
, O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Tiny O
dessert B-negative
was O
$ O
8.00 O
... O
just O
plain O
overpriced O
for O
what O
it O
is O
. O

The O
omlette B-positive
for I-positive
brunch I-positive
is O
great O
... O

Most O
of O
the O
servers B-positive
are O
very O
attentive O
, O
friendly O
and O
quite O
attractive O
. O

It O
is O
one O
the O
nicest O
outdoor B-positive
restaurants I-positive
I O
have O
ever O
seen O
in O
NY O
-- O
I O
am O
from O
Italy O
and O
this O
place O
rivals O
the O
ones O
in O
my O
country O
. O

It O
's O
absolutely O
wonderful O
and O
worth O
the O
price B-positive
! O

After O
2 O
months O
of O
complaints O

Asus O

An O
excellent O

They O
were O
such O
a O

( O
$ O
8.95 O
for O
four O
small O
meat B-negative
patties I-negative
in I-negative
steamed I-negative
buns I-negative
) O
and O
not O
worth O
trying O
. O

I O
am O
happy O
i O
did O
the O
food B-positive
was O
awesome O
. O

Look O
, O
the O
appetizers B-positive
were O
really O
good O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
Apple O

quality B-negative
has O
continued O
to O
slide O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
amazing O
! O
! O
! O
! O

The O
DJ B-positive
is O
awesome O
, O
I O
have O
been O
there O
for O
my O
birthday O
and O
a O
bunch O
of O
other O
times O
with O
friends O

I O
keep O
going O
back O

My O
husband O
said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion B-positive
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive
fries I-positive
were O
the O
best O
he O
has O
had O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-negative
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

The O
last O
two O
times O
I O
ordered O
from O
here O
my O
food B-negative
was O
soo O
spicy O
that O
I O
could O
barely O
eat O
it O
, O
and O
the O
spice O
took O
away O
from O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
dish O
. O

My O
friend O
just O
had O
to O
replace O
his O
entire O
motherboard B-negative
, O
so O
did O
my O
wife O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
I O
will O
have O
to O
as O
well O
. O

The O

All O
the O
various O
Greek B-positive
and I-positive
Cypriot I-positive
dishes I-positive
are O
excellent O
, O
but O
the O
gyro O
is O
the O
reason O
to O
come O
-- O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
eat O
one O
your O
trip O
was O
wasted O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
mostly O
made O
from O

, O
fresh O
and O
well O
prepared O
. O

the O
waitstaffs B-positive
are O
nice O
though O
. O

He O

The O

although O
I O
would O

say O
the O

anything O

Service B-negative

The O

The O

the O

was O
too O
rich O
for O
me O
and O
the O
dessert B-negative
wine I-negative
far O
too O
sweet O

Mussles B-positive

Saturday O

, O
and O

anyone O
looking O
for O
a O
casual O
atmosphere B-positive
that O
whisks O
you O
away O
to O
the O

The O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
relaxed O

casual O
. O

The O
table O
service B-neutral
could O
have O
been O
a O
little O
more O

also O
works O

I O
understood O

were O
busy O

The O
waiter B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
unfriendly O
and O
the O
feel B-negative
of O
the O

was O
crowded O
. O

Many O
people O
talk O
about O
the O
great O

and O
poor O

, O
so O
it O
ca O

HORRID O

The O

are O
small O
enough O
to O
be O
very O
portable O
yet O
hold O
tons O

Another O
issue O
I O

( O
even O
its O
low O

the O

horrible O
, O
the O

pathetic O
, O
and O
gabriella O

It O

The O

We O
could O

The O
food B-positive

My O

I O
think O
this O

a O

The O
`` O

This O

was O
way O
overhyped O

I O
almost O
hesititate O
to O
write O
a O
review O
because O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
so O
great O
and O
I O
would O
hate O
for O
it O
too O
become O
to O
crowded O

Navigation B-positive
through O
the O

Service B-negative
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O

I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
for O
summer O
, O
when O
they O
serve O
outside O
on O
their O
gigantic O

. O

The O

was O

We O
went O
around O
9:30 O
on O
a O
Friday O
and O
it O
had O
died O
down O
a O
bit O
by O
then O
so O
the O
service B-positive
was O
great O
! O

Had O
no O
flavor O
and O
the O

is O
rude O

not O

the O

the O
views B-positive

I O
send O

The O

– O
The O
food B-negative
was O
not O
great O
& O
the O
waiters B-negative
were O
rude O

My O

said O
he O
could O
've O
eaten O
several O
more O
, O
the O
portion O
was O
fine O
for O
me O
he O
even O
exclaimed O
that O
the O
french B-positive

were O
the O
best O
he O

Not O
much O
of O
a O

Was O

it O
much O
less O
love O
it O
so O
I O
went O
to O
a O
local O
best O

and O
played O
around O
with O
the O
IOS B-positive
system I-positive
on O
a O
Mac O
Pro O
and O
it O
was O
totally O
unique O
and O
different O
. O

The O
battery B-negative
life I-negative
also O
does O
n't O
keep O
up O
with O
the O
claim O
but O
still O
I O
think O
macbook O
is O
much O
ahead O
from O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

. O

Big B-positive
Wong I-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O

. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
comes O
with O
an O
i5 B-positive
processor I-positive
definitely O
speeds O
things O
up O

The O
wine B-positive
selection I-positive
( O
by O
the O
glass O

) O
is O
wonderful O
and O
I O
always O
recommend O
that O
friends O
make O
a O
reservation B-neutral
if O
they O
're O
going O
to O
be O
in O

. O

The O

and O
the O

down O
the O

which O
is O
not O
as O
good O

it O
used O

Maybe O
it O
was O
the O
great O
company O
( O
I O
had O
friends O
visiting O
from O
Philly O
– O
yes O
, O
it O

Food B-positive

Make O

you O

Only O
a O

I O

be O
horrified O

early O

Our O

The O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-neutral
and O
they O
were O
huge O

We O
started O
off O
with O
a O
delightful O
sashimi B-positive
amuse I-positive

I O
've O
had O
my O
computer O
for O
2 O
weeks O
already O
and O
it O
works B-positive
perfectly O
. O

This O
is O
the O
kind O
of O
place B-positive
you O
'd O
like O
to O
take O
all O
your O
friends O
to O
and O
still O
keep O
a O
secret O
. O

im O
not O
necessarily O
fanatical O
about O
this O
place B-positive
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
fun O
time O
for O
low O
pirces O
. O

The O
service B-neutral
was O
ok O
. O

Be O
sure O
to O
try O
the O
oyster B-positive
roll I-positive

I'ts O
nice O
to O
have O
the O
higher-end O

but O
this O
fits O
my O
budget O
and O
the O

I O
need O

Meanwhile O
, O
the O
bartender O
continued O
to O
pour O
champagne O
from O
his O
reserve O
after O
we O
had O
finished O
our O

we O
enjoyed O

We O
were O
disappointed O
with O
the O
pre-fixe B-negative
menu I-negative
of O
only O
2 O
choices B-neutral
per I-neutral
course I-neutral
( O
other O
restaurants O
offer O
3 O
choices O
) O
and O
ended O
up O
ordering O
a O
la O
carte O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-positive
as O
an O
appetizer O
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-positive
was O
wonderful O
. O

I O
'm O
partial O
to O
the O
Gnocchi B-positive
. O

Overall O
the O
food B-positive
quality O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
though O
I O
hear O
the O
salmon O
is O
much O
better O
when O
it O
has O
n't O
sat O
cooling O
in O
front O
of O
the O
guest O
. O

Very O
affordable O
and O
excellent O
ambient B-positive
! O

The O
service B-negative
is O
a O
little O
scatty O
at O
times O
but O
all O
is O
forgiven O
when O
the O
food B-positive
arrives O
. O

Judging O
from O
previous O
posts O
this O
used O
to O
be O
a O
good O
place B-negative
, O
but O
not O
any O
longer O
. O

Great O
for O
groups O
, O
great O
for O
a O
date O
, O
great O
for O
early O
brunch B-positive
or O
a O
nightcap B-positive
. O

it O
's O
the O
only O
place O
you O
can O
get O
yummy O
authentic O
japanese B-positive
comfort I-positive
food I-positive
. O

The O
only O
thing O
more O
wonderful O
than O
the O
food B-positive
( O
which O
is O
exceptional O
) O
is O
the O
service B-positive
. O

The O
decor B-positive
is O
night O
tho O
... O
but O
they O
REALLY O
need O
to O
clean O
that O
vent B-negative
in O
the O
ceiling O
... O
its O
quite O
un-appetizing O
, O
and O
kills O
your O
effort O
to O
make O
this O
place B-negative
look O
sleek O
and O
modern O
. O

Service B-positive
was O
wonderful O
; O

I O
recommend O
getting O
a O
reservation B-neutral
even O
though O
we O
saw O
people O
seated O
without O
one O
. O

All O
in O
all O
the O
food B-positive
was O
above O
average O
and O
I O
would O
return O
to O
see O
how O
they O
operate O
with O
four O
or O
less O
dinners O
. O

It O
's O
software B-positive
and O
speed B-positive
enable O
it O
to O
do O
amazing O
things O

Ingredients B-positive
are O
organic O
which O
is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

The O
lobster B-negative
sandwich I-negative
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
software B-negative
I O
have O
wo O
n't O
work O
with O
Mac O
and O
iWork B-negative
is O
not O
worth O
the O
price B-negative
of O
it O
. O

Cute O
place B-negative
, O
nice O
wait B-positive
staff I-positive
but O
would O
never O
go O
there O
again O

More O
times O
that O
not O
the O
screen O
pops O
up O
saying O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
internet B-negative
connection I-negative
, O
or O
the O

ca O
n't O
be O

I O
really O
like O
the O
size B-positive
and O
I O
'm O
a O
fan O
of O
the O
ACERS O
. O

We O
got O
a O
little O
tipsy O
from O
the O
sake B-neutral
but O
is O
n't O
that O
what O
Saturday O
nights O
with O
the O
girlfriends O
are O
all O
about O
? O

A O
glass B-positive

Leaping I-positive
Lizard I-positive
, O
a O
glass B-positive
of I-positive
prosecco I-positive

and O
the O

had O
everything O
happy O

Although O
the O
tables B-negative
may O
be O
closely O
situated O
, O
the O
candle-light B-positive
, O
food B-positive
quality O
and O
service B-positive
overcompensate O
. O

Here O
are O
the O
things O
that O
made O
me O
confident O
with O
my O
purchase O
: O
Build B-positive
Quality I-positive
- O
Seriously O
, O
you O
ca O
n't O
beat O
a O
unibody B-positive
construction I-positive
. O

The O
place B-positive
was O
quiet O
and O
delightful O
. O

Staff B-positive
is O
very O
accomodating O
. O

Prices B-positive
even O
outside O
of O
restaurant O
week O
were O
great O
. O

Info O
: O
Windows B-negative
failed O
to O
load O
because O
the O
kernal B-negative
is O
missing O
, O
or O
corrupt O
. O

THIS O
STAFF B-negative
SHOULD O
BE O
FIRED O
. O

The O
case B-negative
is O
now O
slightly O
larger O
than O
the O
previous O
generation O
, O
but O
the O
lack O
of O
an O
external B-neutral
power I-neutral
supply I-neutral
justifies O
the O
small O
increase O
in O
size O
. O

Its O
location B-positive
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan B-positive
again O
and O
again O
. O

The O
pickles B-positive
were O
great O
addition O
. O

The O
best O
Chicken B-positive
pad I-positive
tai I-positive
, O
I O
've O
ever O
had O
. O

To O
sum O
it O
up O
: O
Service B-neutral
varies O
from O
good O
to O
mediorce O
, O
depending O
on O
which O
waiter O
you O
get O
; O
generally O
it O
is O
just O
average O
Ok O
. O

Pizza B-negative
was O
a O
little O
soggy O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive
. O

The O
menu B-positive
looked O
great O
, O
and O
the O
waiter B-positive
was O
very O
nice O
, O
but O
when O
the O
food B-neutral
came O
, O
it O
was O
average O
. O

the O
mouse B-negative
buttons I-negative
are O
hard O
to O
push O
. O

Probably O
much O
busier O
for O
lunch B-neutral
, O
it O
's O
seldom O
crowded O
for O
dinner B-neutral
( O
too O
close O
to O
downtown O
) O
. O

I O
had O
always O
used O
PCs O
and O
been O
constantly O
frustrated O
by O
the O
crashing O
and O
the O
poorly O
designed O
operating B-negative
systems I-negative
that O
were O
never O
very O
intuitive O
. O

Considering O
we O
were O
the O
last O
patrons O
there O
and O
it O
was O
after O
the O
closing O
time O
, O
the O
waitstaff B-positive
did O
not O
rush O
us O
at O
all O
and O
made O
us O
feel O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
. O

It O
's O
a O
tiny O
place B-neutral
so O
if O
you O
get O
there O
before O
8pm O
on O
a O
weekend O
( O
Thurs O
? O
Sun O
) O
you O
will O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
get O
a O
table O
or O
a O
seat O
at O
the O
sushi O
bar O
. O

I O
would O
never O
wait O
for O
a O
table B-neutral
to O
eat O
, O
it O
just O
is O
not O
THAT O
great O
. O

Excellent O
spot B-positive
for O
holiday O
get O
togethers O
with O
co-workers O
or O
friends O
that O
you O
have O
n't O
seen O

The O
dessert O
( O
we O
had O
a O
pear B-positive
torte I-positive
) O
was O
good O
- O
but O
, O
once O
again O
, O
the O
staff B-negative
was O
unable O
to O
provide O
appropriate O
drink O
suggestions O
. O

The O
atmosphere B-negative
is O
n't O
the O
greatest O
, O
but O
I O
suppose O
that O
's O
how O
they O
keep O
the O
prices O
down O
. O

It O
runs B-positive
perfectly O

I O
would O
never O
recommend O
this O

great O

The O
main O
draw O

the O
price B-positive

Great O

The O

Unfortunately O

The O
Pastrami B-positive

an O
icy O
cold O

to O

it O
down O

The O
food B-positive
was O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
service B-positive

I O
was O

I O
started O
out O

was O
big O
enough O
for O

Eating O
in O
, O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
saves O
it O
, O
but O
at O
your O
desk O
, O
it O
's O
a O
very O
disappointing O
experience O
. O

They O
're O
also O
friendlier O
here O
, O
especially O
the O
owner B-positive
, O
Kenny O
. O

The O

The O
flavors B-positive
are O
very O
fresh O

pretty O

THIS O

The O

I O
wish O

This O

The O

the O

I O
had O
a O
taste O

all O
three O

on O
her O

they O
were O
superb O

expected O
it O

You O
rarely O
have O
to O
wait O

the O
currys B-positive
( I-positive
masaman I-positive

are O
full O

We O
did O

want O
a O

so O
we O
each O
got O
little O
bottles B-positive

That O
whole O

just O
ridiculous O
we O
sent O
it O
in O

after O
they O
told O
us O
that O
we O
had O
to O
pay O
$ O
175 O
to O
fix O
it O
we O
were O
like O
we O
will O
just O
by O
a O
portable O
mouse B-positive
which O
would O
be O
way O
cheaper O
but O
they O
refused O
to O
send O
the O
laptop O
back O
until O
we O
paid O
the O
$ O
175 O
and O
it O
was O
fixed O

after O
8 O

the O
chole B-positive

but O
the O
dhosas B-negative

kinda O
disappointing O

They O
pay O
such O
detail O
to O
everything O
from O
miso O

The O
desert B-positive

The O

My O

barely O
touched O
that O
mess O
of O
a O

This O
place O
has O
good O
potential O

needs O
a O
significant O
amount O

work O
before O
we O
can O
justify O

that O
much O
money B-negative
on O
indian O

My O

called O

that O
I O
was O

that O
it O
was O
most O
likely O
an O
oyster O

and O
that O
we O
were O
also O
blacklisted O
from O

– O
In O
a O
age O
of O
incremental O
cost O
cutting O

its O
nice O
to O
see O
a O

that O

just O
plain O
delivers O
high O
quality O
food B-positive

The O

We O

The O

But O
sitting O

on O
a O

it O
looks O
more O

( O
this O
could O
be O
because O
Im O
used O
to O
my O

the O

they O

it O

We O

This O

The O
Computer O

a O
good O
product O

the O

They O
treated O

the O

extremely O
fresh O

The O
highly O
spiced O
chai B-positive
tea I-positive
was O
great O
too O

Its O
location B-positive
is O

and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O

their O
prices O

very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O

go O

All O
of O
the O

It O

hard O

The O
restaurant B-neutral

that O
is O
something O
that O
can O
be O
overlooked O
once O
you O
sit O
down O

It O
saves O
walking O

waiting B-negative
for O
a O
table O
in O
the O
often O
noisy O
, O
crowded O
bar B-negative

Also O
, O
they O
serve O
THE O
best O
hummus B-positive
in O
America O

with O
a O
drizzle O
of O
fragrant O
olive O
oil O
( O
which O
, O
I O
believe O
is O
the O
traditional O
way O
) O
! O

The O
pricing B-positive
is O
very O
competitive O

The O
ambience B-positive
was O
so O
fun O
, O
and O
the O
prices O
were O
great O

on O

of O
the O

only O
thing O
that O

the O

( O
not O

It O

super O

a O

The O

about O
$ O

The O

To O

off O

you O
must O
have O
dessert O

especially O
the O
White O

Food B-positive

good O

the O

terrific O
even O
on O
a O

I O
went O

I O
literally O
just O
got O
back O
home O
after O
visiting O
Casa B-negative
La I-negative
Femme I-negative
and O
was O
so O
offended O

my O

felt O
it O
necessary O
to O
try O
and O
warn O
other O
diners O
who O
value O
their O
money O

They O

it O
all O

'd O
be O
horrified O

my O

turning O
away O

so O
early O

so O
rudely O

If O
you O
like O
your O

The O
selection B-positive

is O
excellent O
( O
I O
'm O
not O
used O
to O
having O
much O
choice O
at O

, O
and O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
great O

-I O
propose O
that O
they O
can O
just O
swap O
the O
hard B-neutral
drives I-neutral

Service B-negative
was O
just O
ok O
, O
it O
is O
not O
what O
you O
'd O
expect O
for O
$ O
500 O

The O
food B-positive
is O
all O
shared O
so O
we O
get O

eat O
together O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
authentic O
Italian O
- O
delicious O

Ravioli B-positive
was O
good O
... O
but O
I O
have O
to O
say O
that O
I O
found O
everything O
a O
bit O
overpriced O
. O

The O
bread B-negative
was O
stale O
, O
the O
salad B-negative
was O
overpriced O
and O
empty O
. O

You O
ca O
n't O
go O
wrong O
with O
this O
place B-positive

While O
I O
could O
have O
done O
without O
the O
youth O
who O
shared O
the O
evening O
with O
us O
, O
our O
wonderful O
server B-positive
and O
food B-positive
made O
the O
experience O
a O
very O
positive O
one O

( O
I O
found O
a O
2GB O
stick O
for O
a O
bit O
under O
$ O
50 O
) O
Nice O
and O
portable O
and O
definitely O
a O
decent O
enough O
system B-positive
to O
keep O
you O
entertained O
while O
sitting O
in O
the O
airplane O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
, O
or O
at O
the O
hotel O
taking O
care O
of O
some O
last O

I O
was O
a O
little O
weary O
at O
purchasing O
another O
13 O
'' O
macbook O
almost O
2 O
years O
later O
but O
t O
looks O
like O
the O

gotten O
its O
current O
line O
of O

cards I-positive
in O
order O
this O
time O
around O

Our O

was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-positive
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

It O
's O
a O
great O
place B-positive
to O
order O
from O
or O
sit-in O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
atmosphere B-negative
is O
lacking O
, O
but O
what O
do O
you O
expect O
from O
a O
24 O
hour O
bagel O
place O
anyways O
? O

After O
replacing O
the O
spinning O
hard O
disk O
with O
an O

my O

I O
wish O
the O
volume B-negative

be O
louder O
and O
the O
mouse B-negative
didnt O
break O
after O
only O
a O
month O

Downstairs B-positive

always O
a O
good O
attraction O

This O
is O
an O
amazing O
place O
to O
try O
some O
roti B-positive
rolls I-positive
. O

I O
think O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
so O
overrated O
and O
was O
under O
cooked O
. O

Another O
plus O
is O
the O
open O
feel B-positive
of O
the O
restaurant O
with O
glass O

all O
sides O

Not O
only O

the O

I O

their O
eggs B-negative

which O
were O
the O
worst O
in O

I O
tried O
removing O
the O
hollondaise O

completely O
that O
was O
how O
failed O
it O
was O

also O
it O

great O
to O
have O

very O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O
place B-positive

the O
service B-positive
it O
's O
just O
perfect O
... O
they O
're O
so O
frendly O
that O
we O
never O
want O

the O

I O
almost O
hesititate O

this O
the O

So O
, O
the O

Service B-positive

I O

as O
if O
this O

any O
major O

but O
now O
it O

simply O
repulsive O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O

ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O

the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O

However O
, O
their O
popularity O
has O
yet O
to O
slow O
down O
, O
and O
I O
still O
find O
myself O
drawn O
to O
their O
ambiance B-positive
and O
delectable O
reputation O

We O
all O
had O
the O
tasting O

unlike O
some O
of O
the O
other O
reviews O
, O
I O
felt O
there O
was O
more O

The O
one O
thing O
I O
wish O

was O

But O
other O

that O
I O

also O
have O
empenadas B-positive

plaintains B-positive
which O
are O
good O
for O
an O

Their O
Margarita B-positive
is O
best O
I O
've O
had O
since O
I O
've O
returned O
from O

The O

so O
watch O
out O

little O
Nolita O

terrible O

Until O

that O

five O
minutes O
is O
meaningless O
and O
your O
wait B-negative
may O
be O
anywhere O
from O
two O
to O
twenty O
minutes O
it O
may O
be O
frustrating O
. O

Excellent O
food B-positive

although O
the O

use O
some O
help O

Try O
the O
ribs B-positive

sizzling O
beef B-positive
and O
couple O
it O
with O
coconut O

You O
must O
try O
the O

Cafe O
St. O
Bart O

their O

the O

handing O
us O
a O

well O
over O

their O

Such O
nice O
people B-positive
working O
here O
- O
but O
I O
have O
to O
review O
the O
food O
. O

My O
wife O
had O
the O
fried B-positive
shrimp I-positive
which O
are O
huge O
and O
loved O
it O
. O

The O
lobster B-negative
sandwich I-negative
is O
$ O
24 O
and O
although O
it O
was O
good O
it O
was O
not O
nearly O
enough O
to O
warrant O
that O
price O
. O

I O
have O
reservations O
about O
the O
all B-negative
you I-negative
can I-negative
eat I-negative
deal I-negative
, O
however O
-- O
the O
choices O
are O
fairly O
limited O
and O
you O
can O
probably O
order O
more O
food O
than O
you O
can O
eat O
for O
less O
than O
$ O
18 O
by O
just O
going O
off O
the O
menu O
. O

The O
PhotoBooth B-positive
is O
a O
great O
program B-positive
, O
it O
takes O
very O
good O
pictures O
with O
the O
built-in B-positive
camera I-positive
. O

20 O
minutes O
for O
our O
reservation O
but O
it O
gave O
us O
time O
to O
have O
a O
few O
cocktails O
and O
enjoy O
our O
surroundings B-positive
and O
each O
other O
. O

It O
is O
kinda O
nosiy O
and O
the O
tables B-negative
are O
close O
together O
but O
it O
's O
still O
a O
beautiful O
place B-positive
to O
enjoy O
a O
nice O
dinner B-positive
. O

Put O
a O
SSD O
and O
use O
a O
21 O
'' O
LED O

, O
this O
set B-positive
up I-positive
is O
silky O

THE O
LASAGNA B-positive
WAS O
PROBABLY O
THE O
BEST O
I O
HAVE O
TASTED O
. O

The O
specialty O
here O
is O
decadent O
pancakes B-positive
, O
but O
I O
've O
been O
back O
now O
four O
times O
, O
and O
I O
've O
been O
wowed O
every O
time O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
and O
the O
environment B-positive
is O
even O
better O
. O

Very O
good O
wine B-positive
choices I-positive
. O

now O
called O
nikki O
sushi O
, O
sushi B-neutral
is O
OK O
. O

The O
food B-positive
tasted O
very O
good O
. O

Be O
prepared O
to O
wait O
, O
because O
the O
place B-negative
is O
pretty O
tiny O
. O

The O
waiters B-positive
are O
very O
friendly O
and O
helpful O
and O
if O
you O
frequent O
they O
will O
remember O
you O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

) O
It O
's O
not O
the O
best O
Japanese O
restaurant O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
pretty O
solid O
one O
for O
its O
modest O
prices B-positive
, O
and O
worth O
repeat O
visits O
. O

I O
got O
the O
shellfish B-neutral
and I-neutral
shrimp I-neutral
appetizer I-neutral
and O
it O
was O
alright O
. O

I O
was O
frankly O
shocked O
when O
I O
read O
the O
bad O
reviews O
- O
this O
place B-positive
is O
fantastic O
; O
it O
has O
not O
let O
us O
down O
in O
any O
way O
, O
and O
we O
've O
eaten O
here O
more O
than O
10 O
times O
. O

The O
AC B-negative
power I-negative
port I-negative
becomes O
loose O
over O
time O

The O
strong O
scents B-negative
coming O
from O
the O
left O
and O
right O
of O
me O
negatively O
affected O
my O
taste O
buds O
. O

The O
processor B-positive
screams O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
unique O
way O
that O
Apple O
OSX B-positive
16 I-positive
functions O
, O
most O
of O
the O
graphics O
are O
routed O
through O
the O
hardware O
rather O
than O
the O
software O
. O

The O
price B-positive
is O
reasonable O
although O
the O
service B-negative
is O
poor O
. O

The O
waitress B-positive
was O
very O
patient O
with O
us O
and O
the O
food B-positive
is O
phenomenal O
! O

The O
price B-negative
premium I-negative
is O
a O
little O
much O
, O
but O
when O
you O
start O
looking O
at O
the O
features B-positive
it O
is O
worth O
the O
added O
cash O
. O

We O
carry O
the O
netbook O
around O
here O
and O
there O
, O
hence O
it O
's O
kinda O
of O
irritating O
when O
the O
LCD B-negative
just O
`` O
slide O
'' O
downwards O
. O

Quick O
and O
friendly O
service B-positive
. O

Do O
n't O
dine O
at O
Tamarind O
for O
the O
vegetarian B-negative
dishes I-negative
, O
they O
are O
simply O
not O
up O
to O
par O
with O
the O
non-veg O
selections O
. O

Go O
to O
Volare O
for O
1st O
class O
service B-positive
and O
terrific O
food B-positive
. O

The O
kitchen B-negative
however O
, O
is O
almost O
always O
slow O
. O

I O
definitely O
suggest O
getting O
an O
extended B-positive
warranty I-positive
, O
you O
will O
probably O
need O
it O
! O

The O
hot B-positive
dogs I-positive
are O
top O
notch O
, O
and O
they O
're O
Slamwich B-positive
is O
amazing O
! O

After O
all O
that O
, O
they O
complained O
to O
me O
about O
the O
small O
tip B-negative
. O

The O
bread B-negative
we O
received O
was O
horrible O
- O
rock O
hard O
and O
cold O
- O
and O
the O
`` O
free O
'' O
appetizer B-negative
of I-negative
olives I-negative
was O
disappointing O
. O

I O
'll O
being O
with O
a O
couple O
of O
positives O
: O
cool O
decor B-positive
, O
good O
pita B-positive
and O
hummus B-positive
, O
and O
grilled B-positive
octopus I-positive
that O
was O
actually O
pretty O
tasty O
. O

Awesome O
Pizza B-positive
especially O
the O
Margheritta B-positive
slice O
. O

There O
is O
no O
number O
pad B-negative
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
keyboard B-negative
which O
is O
a O
bummer O
. O

not O
only O
does O
make O
the O
best O
pizza B-positive
in O
NY O
, O
maybe O
anywhere O
. O

the O
mouse B-negative
pad I-negative
and O
buttons B-negative
are O
the O
worst O
i O
've O
ever O
seen O
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-negative
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware O
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

The O
pizza B-positive
was O
great O
. O

With O
the O
softwares B-neutral
supporting O
the O
use O
of O
other O
OS B-neutral
makes O
it O
much O
better O
. O

We O
had O
the O
lobster B-positive
sandwich I-positive
and O
it O
was O
FANTASTIC O
. O

My O
vegetable B-negative
risotto I-negative
was O
burnt O
, O
and O
infused O
totally O
in O
a O
burnt O
flavor B-negative
. O

Never O
in O
my O
life O
did O
I O
think O
that O
I O
could O
be O
satisfied O
both O
in O
taste B-positive
and O
in O
quantity B-positive
for O
$ O
3.00 O
in O
NYC O
. O

It O
runs B-positive
very O
quiet O
too O
which O
is O
a O
plus O
. O

A O
touch O
more O
jalapeno B-positive
heat O
for O
contrast O
and O
it O
would O
have O
been O
very O
good O
indeed O
. O

This O
is O
the O
perfect O
spot B-positive
for O
meeting O
friends O
, O
having O
lunch O
, O
dinner O
, O
pre-theatre O
or O
after-theatre O
drinks O

so O
about O
the O
prawns B-positive
, O
they O
were O
fresh O
and O
had O
a O
slight O
crispiness O
about O
the O
batter B-positive
... O
soooo O
good O
... O
the O
walnuts B-positive
were O
cut O
in O
smaller O
pieces O
and O
very O
crunchy O
and O
tasty O
. O

By O
far O
, O
the O
best O
pizza B-positive
in O
Manhattan O
. O

I O
tend O
to O
judge O
a O
sushi O
restaurant O
by O
its O
sea B-positive
urchin I-positive
, O
which O
was O
heavenly O
at O
sushi O
rose O
. O

The O
mussels B-positive
were O
fantastic O
and O
so O
was O
the O
dessert B-positive
... O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
back O

soon O

The O
food B-negative

just O
awful O

I O
barely O
understood O
1 O
word O
when O
the O

If O

The O

are O
sweet O

the O
food B-positive

tasty O
and O
the O
bill B-positive
is O
never O
too O
large O

All O
my O

were O
amazed O
at O
how O
small O
the O

was O

packing B-positive

everything O
was O
perfect O

The O

is O
ok O
, O
some O
of O
the O
people O
did O
n't O
get O
what O
they O
asked O
for O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
delicious O
and O
clearly O
fresh O

the O

For O
years O

I O
thought O
Tuscan O

me O
to O
the O
hearty O
Neapolitan B-positive
fare I-positive

The O

the O

actually O

go O

some O
of O
those O
exotic O

For O
the O
next O
hour O
and O

listening O

all O

in O

the O

All O
in O
all O
, O
I O
would O
return O
- O
as O
it O
was O
a O
beautiful O
restaurant B-positive
- O
but O
I O
hope O
the O
staff O
pays O
more O
attention O
to O
the O
little O
details O
in O
the O
future O
. O

Excellent O
atmosphere B-positive

The O

are O
creative O

to O
find O
another O

up O
more O
inventive O
yet O
delicious O

A O

Best O

food I-positive
in O
NY O
! O

All O
the O
programs B-positive
are O
easy O
and O
straight O
forward O
on O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
it O
is O
clean O
and O
organized O
, O
which O
I O
always O
strive O
to O
be O
myself O
. O

Even O
if O
the O
food B-positive
was O
n't O
this O
good O
, O
the O
garden B-positive
is O
a O
great O
place O
to O
sit O
outside O
and O
relax O
. O

We O
were O
greeted O
promptly O
by O
the O
waiter B-positive
who O
was O
very O
nice O
and O
cordial O
. O

Runs B-positive
very O
smoothly O
. O

Also O
, O
specify O
if O
you O
like O
your O
food B-neutral
spicy- O
its O
rather O
bland O
if O
you O
do O
n't O
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon O
salad O
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper B-negative
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

When O
I O
got O
there O
I O
sat O
up O
stairs O
where O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
was O
cozy O
& O
the O
service B-negative
was O
horrible O
! O

All O
apple B-positive
associates I-positive
are O
always O
willing O
to O
help O
you O
out O
with O
anything O
, O
no O
matter O
when O
you O
purchased O
the O
computer O
and O
how O
many O
years O
passed O
. O

We O
had O
Pam B-positive
's I-positive
special I-positive
fried I-positive
fish I-positive
and O
it O
was O
amazing O
. O

My O
mom O
originally O
introduced O
me O
to O
this O
place O
, O
but O
even O
she O
( O
being O
Indian O
) O
feels O
the O
food B-negative
can O
be O
somewhat O
over O
the O
top O
spicy O
and O
far O
too O
oily O
. O

It O
is O
the O
perfect O
size B-positive
and O
speed B-positive
for O
me O
. O

Shame O
on O
this O
place O
for O
the O
horrible O
rude O
staff B-negative
and O
non-existent O
customer B-negative
service I-negative
. O

Great O
survice B-positive

I O
heard O
the O
lobster B-positive
roll I-positive
was O
excellent O
. O

The O
food B-neutral
however O
, O
is O
what O
one O
might O
expect O
. O

My O
one O
complaint O
with O
this O
laptop O
is O
that O
I O
've O
noticed O
an O
electronic B-negative
fuzz I-negative
sound I-negative
coming O
out O
of O
the O
headphone B-negative
jack I-negative
when O
headphones O
are O
plugged O
in O
. O

The O
best O
pad B-positive
thai I-positive
i O
've O

had O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
consistently O
wonderful O
- O
I O
've O
been O
coming O
here O
for O
years O
, O
and O
the O
owner B-positive
has O
always O
been O
accomodating O
and O
friendly O
. O

Despite O
a O
slightly O
limited O
menu B-negative
, O
everything O
prepared O
is O
done O
to O
perfection O
, O
ultra O
fresh O
and O
a O
work O
of O
food O
art O
. O

Mine O
was O
a O
little O
burnt O
but O
still O
delicious O
with O
goat O
cheese O
and O
panchetta O
( O
raddichio B-negative
was O
kind O
of O
bitter O
though O
) O
. O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-positive
, O
the O
owner B-positive
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-positive
is O
fast O
. O

The O
hostess B-negative
and O
the O
waitress B-negative
were O
incredibly O
rude O
and O
did O
everything O
they O
could O
to O
rush O
us O
out O
. O

It O
pretty O
much O
does O
everything O
we O
could O
ever O
need O
, O
and O
looks O
great O
to O
boot B-positive
. O

Highly O
impressed O
from O
the O
decor B-positive
to O
the O
food B-positive
to O
the O
hospitality O
to O
the O
great O
night O
I O
had O
! O

Easy O
to O
carry B-positive
, O
can O
be O
taken O
anywhere O
, O
can O
be O
hooked O
up O
to O
printers O
, O
headsets O
. O

Cozy O
romantic O
atomosphere B-positive
with O
only O
around O
15 O
tables O
at O
most O
. O

Service B-negative
was O
awful O
- O
mostly O
because O
staff B-negative
were O
overwhelmed O
on O
a O
Saturday O
night O
. O

The O
drinks B-positive
are O
a O
saving O
grace O
, O
but O
service O
staff O
, O
please O
, O
get O
over O
yourselves O
. O

But O
the O
pizza B-negative
is O
way O
to O
expensive O
. O

We O
love O
the O
food B-positive
, O
drinks B-positive
, O
and O
atmosphere B-positive
! O

Pizza B-positive
here O
is O
consistently O
good O
. O

I O
am O
first O
time O
Mac O
Buyer O
and O
am O
amazed O
at O
features B-positive
and O
ease O
of O
use B-positive
the O
Mac O
offers O
. O

I O
also O
got O
the O
added O
bonus O
of O
a O
30 O
'' O
HD O
Monitor O
, O
which O
really O
helps O
to O
extend O
my O
screen B-neutral
and O
keep O
my O
eyes O
fresh O
! O

The O
gray B-positive
color I-positive
was O
a O
good O
choice O
. O

While O
the O
room B-negative
is O
not O
particularly O
comfortable O
, O
once O
you O
're O
seated O
you O
'll O
forget O
about O
everything O
except O
what O
's O
on O
your O
plate O
. O

By O
far O
the O
best O
salad B-positive
I O
have O
had O
in O
a O
fast O
food O
restaurant O
. O

A O
cheap O
eat B-positive
for O
NYC O
, O
but O
not O

I O
ate O

marinated I-positive
cucumbers I-positive
and I-positive
tomatoes I-positive
with I-positive
lots I-positive
of I-positive
shrimp I-positive
and I-positive
basil I-positive
. O

But O
the O
best O
part O
about O
LS O
is O
the O
late O
night O
atmosphere B-positive
, O
delightfully O
free O
of O
the O
BTs O
. O

Our O
server B-positive
was O
very O
helpful O
and O
friendly O
. O

I O
was O
especially O
impressed O
during O
the O
bday O
party O
when O
the O
waitstaff O
went O
above O
and O
beyond O
in O
helping O
me O
decorate O
and O
bring O
out O
a O
bday O
cake O
as O
well O
as O
offering O

service B-positive
to O
a O
15 O

party O
. O

Delicious O

, O
and O
a O
pretty O
atmosphere B-positive
make O
this O
a O
great O
choice O
for O
dinner B-positive
and O
the O
$ O
5.99 O
lunch B-positive
buffet I-positive
makes O
it O
an O
even O
better O
choice O
for O
lunch B-positive
! O

The O
sandwiches B-negative
are O
dry O
, O
tasteless O
and O
way O
overpriced O
. O

Speakers B-negative
does O
n't O
sound O
that O
great O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
greeted O
me O
warmly O
at O
the O
door O
and O
I O
was O
seated O
promptly O
and O
the O
food B-positive
was O
excellent O
. O

Service B-neutral
is O
average O
. O

I O
ordered O
my O
2012 O
mac O
mini O
after O
being O
disappointed O
with O
spec B-negative
of O
the O
new O

'' O
Imacs O
. O

This O
establishment B-positive
is O
the O
real O
deal O
. O

The O
lemon B-negative
chicken I-negative
tasted O
like O
sticky O
sweet O
donuts O
and O
the O
honey B-negative
walnut I-negative
prawns I-negative
, O
the O
few O
they O
actually O
give O
you O
... O
..were O
not O
good O
. O

I O

Starter I-neutral
to O
Win B-neutral

, O
and O
it O

just O
fine O
. O

In O
mi O
burrito O

here O
was O
nothing O
but O
dark O

that O
had O
that O
cooked O
last O
week O
and O
just O
warmed O
up O
in O
a O
microwave O
taste B-negative
. O

It O
also O
comes O
with O
4G O
of O
RAM O
but O
if O
you O
're O
like O
me O
you O
want O
to O
max O
that O
out O
so O
I O
immediately O
put O
8G O
of O
RAM O
in O
her O
and O
I O
've O
never O
used O
a O
computer O
that O
performs B-positive
better O
. O

Anyway O
, O
in O
early O
July O
of O
this O
year O
, O
the O
DVD B-negative
burner I-negative
stopped O
working O
, O
and O
the O
computer O
stared O
having O
issues O
with O
power B-negative
supply I-negative
. O

This O
little O
place B-positive
is O
wonderfully O
warm O
welcoming O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
is O
very O
kind O
and O
well O
trained O
, O
they O
're O
fast O
, O
they O
are O
always O
prompt O
to O
jump O
behind O
the O
bar O
and O
fix O
drinks O
, O
they O
know O
details O
of O
every O
item O
in O
the O
menu O
and O
make O
excellent O
recomendations O
. O

I O
will O
be O
out O
with O
friends O
and O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
I O
am O
hungry O
and O
I O
only O
crave O
one O
thing O
... O
their O
Pizza B-positive
. O

After O
purchasing O
this O
thing O
, O
I O
find O
out O
that O
I O
need O
a O
special O
interface B-negative
device I-negative
to O
connect O
my O
camera O
, O
and O
that O
it O
can O
not O
be O
purchased O
at O
the O

- O
only O
on O

. O

My O
wife O
and O
I O
always O
enjoy O
the O
young O
, O
not O
always O
well O
trained O
but O
nevertheless O
friendly O
, O
staff B-positive
, O
all O
of O

a O
story O
. O

Our O
food B-positive
was O
great O
too O

The O
cream B-positive
cheeses I-positive

I O
love O

! O

Fish B-negative

. O

Two O
complaints O
-- O
their O
appetizer B-negative
selection I-negative
stinks O
, O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
get O
some O
mozzarella O
sticks O
on O
the O
menu O
. O

If O
it O
seemed O
possible O
to O
do O
so O
while O
there O
I O
would O
have O
fought O
my O
bill O
since O
my O
dinner O
portion O
of O
my O
meal B-negative
was O
inedible O
! O

food B-negative
was O
luke O
warm O

Love O
the O
stability B-positive
of O
the O
Mac B-positive
software I-positive
and O
operating B-positive
system I-positive
. O

Screen B-positive
- O
although O
some O
people O
might O
complain O
about O
low O
res B-positive
which O
I O
think O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
the O
food B-positive
is O
outstanding O
, O
but O
everything O
else O
about O
this O
restaurant O
is O
the O
pits O

an O
unpretensious O

I O
must O
say O
I O
am O
surprised O
by O
the O
bad O
reviews O
of O
the O
restaurant B-positive
earlier O
in O
the O
year O
, O
though O
. O

The O
music B-positive
was O
fascinating O
, O
but O
left O

, O
and O
the O

made O
superb O

Hands O

the O
best O
pizza B-positive
on O
the O

Prefer O
to O
order O
it O

because O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
the O

Cool O

the O

But O
with O
A O
WAY O
Bigger O

in O
a O

it O

really O
good O
pizza B-positive

The O

is O
rude O
to O
the O
point O
of O
being O
offensive O
. O

Try O
the O

or O
sample O
anything O

they O
're O
all O

The O
service B-neutral
is O
not O
consistently O
excellent O
-- O
just O
decent O
. O

The O
apple B-positive
care I-positive
has O
never O
failed O
me O
, O
and O
I O
expect O
it O
to O
be O
the O
same O
for O
this O
computer O
as O
well O
. O

He O
has O
replaced O
his O

twice O
and O
( O
of O

has O
had O
to O
pay O
for O

One O
night O
I O
turned O
the O

the O

Also O
the O
display B-positive
is O
exceptional O
! O

The O
Deco B-positive
and O
ambiance B-positive
was O
really O
romantic O
. O

The O
service B-negative
leaves O
much O
to O
be O
desired O
, O
from O
feeling O
like O
you O
are O
rushed O
the O
place O
your O
order O
, O
to O
being O
ignored O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

The O
service B-negative
ranges O
from O

The O

be O
overlooked O

I O
bought O
this O

found O
its O

The O
people B-negative
in O
the O

were O
pretty O
obnoxious O

This O
place O
is O
a O
great O
stop O
for O
great O

. O

Then O
I O
've O
fixed O
the O
DC B-neutral

rewired O
the O

replaced O

The O

compared O
to O

I O
had O
never O
had O
Edamame B-positive
pureed I-positive
before O
but O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
( O
could O
've O
used O
a O
bit O
more O
salt O
) O
. O

Amma B-neutral
is O
nothing O
special O
. O

We O
had O
the O
scallops B-positive
as O
an O
appetizer B-positive
and O
they O
were O
delicious O
and O
the O
sauce B-positive
was O
wonderful O
. O

Maybe O
it O
is O
good O
for O
that O
one O
night O
once O
in O
a O
blue O
moon O
when O
the O
chefs O
decide O
to O
use O
fish B-negative
that O
's O
half-way O
decent O
. O

Given O
the O
incredible O
architecture B-positive
surrounding O
it O
, O
this O
place B-negative
has O
no O
character O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
food B-positive
and O
ok O
service B-neutral
. O

I O
love O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
pizza B-positive
tastes O
so O
good O
and O
is O
so O
cheap O
. O

The O
DVD B-negative
drive I-negative
randomly O
pops O
open O
when O
it O
is O
in O
my O
backpack O
as O
well O
, O
which O
is O
annoying O
. O

But O
I O
wanted O
the O
Pro O

the O
CD/DVD B-positive

We O
started O
with O
lox B-positive

best O
ive O
ever O

, O
ever O
) O
and O
had O
the O

a O
regular O

to O
the O
consistently O
good O

ease O
of O
getting B-positive
a I-positive
table I-positive
. O

Patroon O
features O
a O
nice O
cigar B-positive
bar I-positive
and O
has O
great O
staff B-positive

The O
concept O
of O
japanese B-negative
tapas I-negative
is O
newly O
created O
and O
clearly O
does O
n't O
work O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
are O
friendly O
and O
the O
decor B-positive
was O
ethic O
and O
colorful O
. O

Sandwiches B-positive
, O
burgers B-positive
and O
salads B-positive
, O
like O
the O
lemon-dressed B-positive
cobb I-positive
, O
are O
classic O
successes O

for O
NY O
life O

... O

Salads B-positive
were O
fantastic O
. O

To O
be O
fair O
, O
the O
food B-positive
still O
is O
good O
and O
the O
service B-positive
is O
quick O
and O
attentative O
even O
though O
its O
usually O
very O
busy O
. O

Now O
mainboard B-negative
is O
broken O
, O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
new O
one O
. O

You O
can O
not O
go O

this O
place B-positive

The O

is O
great O

Drinks B-negative
got O
screwed O
up O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
wish O
this O
had O
was O
the O
option O
to O
turn O
off O
the O
touchpad B-negative
with O
a O
button O
like O
my O
big O
16 O
'' O
laptop O
does O

I O
love O
this O
program B-positive
, O
it O
is O
superior O
to O
windows O
movie O
maker O
. O

The O
sauce B-positive
on I-positive
the I-positive
pizza I-positive
is O
sooo O
good O
with O
garlic O
and O
fresh B-positive
tomatoes I-positive
and O
they O
do O
n't O
skimp O
. O

The O
reflectiveness O
of O
the O
display B-negative
is O
only O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
if O
you O
work O
in O
a O
controlled-lighting O
environment O
like O
me O
( O
I O
prefer O
it O
dark O
) O
or O
if O
you O
can O
crank O
up O
the O
brightness B-neutral
. O

Somehow O
the O
system B-negative
clock I-negative
got O
messed O
up O
after O
reboot O
. O

The O
bruschetta B-positive
and O
panini B-positive
's O
are O
so O
yummy O
! O

Always O
great O
service B-positive
! O

The O
other O
times O
I O
've O
gone O
it O
's O
romantic O
date O
heaven O
, O
you O
can O
walk O
in O
get O
a O
booth O
by O
the O
windows O
, O
be O
treated O
like O
a O
VIP O
in O
a O
not-crowded O
place B-positive
, O
with O
great O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
. O

While O
certain O
staples B-positive
are O
excellent O
( O
the O
burger B-positive
, O
some O
of O
the O
pastas B-positive
) O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
is O
not O
really O
the O
point O
. O

Though O
please O
note O
that O
sometimes O
it O
crashes O
, O
and O
the O
sound B-negative
quality I-negative
isnt O
superb O
. O

While O
we O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-positive
, O
we O
were O
highly O
disappointed O
by O
the O
poor O
service B-negative
( O
waiter B-negative
was O
not O
quite O
competent O
and O
SLOW O
service B-negative
) O
and O
lack O
of O
remorse O
. O

Stuffing O
yourself O
with O
Japanese B-neutral
food I-neutral
is O
a O
rare O
thing O
. O

If O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
have O
a O
nice O
light O
meal B-positive
with O
an O
asian O
accent O
, O
Long O
Tan O
is O
a O
good O
place O
on O
the O
slope O

I O
must O
warn O
the O
reader O
that O
the O
portions B-negative
sizes O
are O
very O
small O
( O
especially O
the O
appetizers B-negative
) O
, O
so O
if O
you O
plan O
to O
eat O
until O
you O
are O
full O
and O
do O
not O
intend O
to O
order O
the O
chef O
's O
special O
tasting O
menu O
, O
prepare O
to O
order O
and O
pay O
for O
an O
appetizer O
( O
1 O
dish O
for O
each O
person O
because O
the O
portions O
are O
not O
for O
sharing O
) O
, O
a O
main O
entree O
, O
and O
the O
cold O
udon O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
meal O
. O

it O
's O
a O
perfect O
place O
to O
have O
a O
amazing O
indian B-positive
food I-positive
. O

We O
left O
without O
ever O
getting O
service B-negative
. O

The O
steak B-positive
was O
excellent O
and O
one O
of O
the O
best O
I O
have O
had O
( O
I O
tasted O
the O
butter O
intitally O
but O
in O
no O
way O
did O
it O
overwhelm O
the O
flavor O
of O
the O
meat O
) O
. O

It O
's O
a O
nice O
place B-positive
to O
relax O
and O
have O
conversation O
. O

But O
with O
this O
laptop O
, O
the O
bass B-negative
is O
very O
weak O
and O
the O
sound B-negative
comes O
out O
sounding O
tinny O
. O

Since O
the O
machine O
's O
slim O
profile B-negative
is O
critical O
to O
me O
, O
that O
was O
a O
problem O
. O

Although O
be O
warned O
their O
dinner B-neutral
menu I-neutral
to I-neutral
sit I-neutral
and O
take O
out O
prices B-neutral
are O
different O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
excellent O
- O
friendly O
and O
attentive O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
cheap O
eats B-positive
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
dreadfully O
slow O
( O
the O
place O
was O
only O
half O
full O
) O
and O
a O
smile O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
... O

This O
place O
, O
however O
, O
has O
a O
lot O
less O
pretension O
than O
Joya O
and O
the O
Thai B-positive
food I-positive
is O
still O
above O
average O
. O

It O
is O
extremely O
portable O
and O
easily O
connects B-positive
to I-positive
WIFI I-positive
at O
the O
library O
and O
elsewhere O
. O

this O
little O
place B-positive
has O
a O
cute O
interior B-positive
decor I-positive
and O
affordable O
city O
prices O
. O

It O
's O
so O
quick O
and O
responsive O
that O
it O
makes O
working B-positive
/ O
surfing B-positive
on O
a O
computer O
so O
much O
more O
pleasurable O
! O

Food B-positive
is O
great O
. O

Shipping B-positive
was O
quick O
and O
product O
described O
was O
the O
product O
sent O
and O
so O
much O
more O
... O

also O
make O
sure O
you O
pay O
attention O
to O
the O
music B-neutral
being O
piped O
in O
- O
quite O
a O
weird O
selection O
. O

The O
bagels B-positive
are O
also O
reasonably O
priced B-positive
for O
NYC O
. O

The O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
is O
build O
your O
own O
computer O
, O
but O
if O
u O
ca O
n't O
company O
's O
like O
dell O
who O
allow O
you O
to O
choose O
the O
components B-positive
are O
better O
and O
for O
the O
same O
price O
you O
can O
get O
a O
computer O
who O
compares O
to O
one O
of O
apple O
$ O
2000 O
systems O
and O
if O
you O
google O
`` O
dell O
coupons O
'' O
you O
can O
find O
codes O
that O
take O
a O
significant O
amount O
off O
the O
price O
. O

Try O
the O
Pad B-positive
Thai I-positive
, O
it O
's O
fabulous O
and O
their O
prices O
are O
so O
cheap O
! O

The O
food B-positive
is O
delicious O
and O
the O
bar B-positive
has O
a O
great O
vibe B-positive
. O

With O
the O
exception O
of O
our O
lemon B-negative
salad I-negative
that O
had O
so O
much O
pepper O
on O
it O
that O
our O
eyes O
started O
watering O
, O
the O
food B-neutral
here O
was O
decent O
, O
not O
great O
. O

The O
screen B-positive
is O
bright O
and O
the O
keyboard B-positive
is O
nice O
; O

The O
view B-positive
is O
breathtaking O
the O
service B-positive
is O
top O

... O
the O
ambiance B-positive
is O
wonderful O
. O

The O
service B-negative
varys O
from O
day O
to O
day- O
sometimes O
they O
're O
very O
nice O
, O
and O
sometimes O
not O
. O

Ess-A-Bagel O
( O
either O
by O
Sty-town O
or O
midtown O

is O
by O
far O
the O
best O
bagel B-positive
in O
NY O
. O

The O
service B-positive
is O
good O
and O
the O
resturant O
is O
clean O
. O

the O
atmosphere B-positive
is O
great O

It O
's O
so O
nice O
that O
the O

long O
and O
that O
this O
machine O
has O
the O
snow O

! O

Their O
tuna B-positive
tartar I-positive
appetizer I-positive
is O
to O
die O
for O

Great O

at O
REASONABLE O
prices B-positive
, O
makes O
for O
an O
evening O
that O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O

The O
waitress B-negative
was O
not O
attentive O
at O
all O
. O

I O
like O
iTunes B-positive
, O
the O
apparent O
security B-positive
, O
the O
Mini O
form O
factor O
, O
all O
the O
nice O
graphics B-positive
stuff I-positive
. O

The O
system B-negative
constantly O
overheats O
, O
the O
battery B-negative
life I-negative
is O
too O
short O
, O
the O
case B-negative
is O
coming O
apart O
, O
and O
my O
core B-negative
applications I-negative
that O
I O
use O
every O
day O
in O
my O
work O
as O
a O
graphic O
artist O
run O
poorly O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
is O
excellent O
, O
special O
: O
that O
girl O
behind O
the O
bar B-neutral
, O
european O
chic O
. O

If O
you O
really O
want O
a O
bang-up O
system B-positive
and O
do O
n't O
need O
to O
run O
Windows O
applications O
, O
go O
with O
an O
Apple O
; O

Went O
here O
last O
night O
- O
nice O
decor B-positive
, O
good O
service B-positive
, O
but O
the O
food B-positive
was O
surprisingly O
excellent O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
was O
accomodating O
, O
the O
food B-positive
was O
absolutely O
delicious O
and O
the O
place B-positive
is O
lovely O

The O
staff B-positive
was O
the O
friendliest O
that O
have O
seen O
in O
New O
York O
. O

delicious O
simple O
food B-positive
in O
nice O
outdoor O
atmosphere B-positive
. O

stick O
with O
the O
chicken B-positive
, O
beef B-positive
, O
and O
lamb B-positive
dishes I-positive
. O

Their O
bagels B-negative
are O
fine O
, O
but O
they O
are O
a O
little O
overcooked O
, O
and O
not O
really O
a O
'special O
' O
bagel O
experience O
. O

The O
folding B-negative
chair I-negative
I O
was O
seated O
at O
was O
uncomfortable O
. O

Not O
only O
is O
the O
service B-positive
great O
, O
but O
forming O
conversation O
around O
a O
table O
is O
so O
easy O
beacuse O
the O
atmosphere B-positive
can O
be O
both O
romantic O
and O
comfortable O
. O

Great O
wine B-positive
selection I-positive
, O
Gigondas B-positive
is O
worth O
the O
price O
, O
and O
the O
house B-positive
champagne I-positive
is O
a O
great O
value O
. O

In O
an O
area O
sadly O
lacking O
in O
decent O
Thai B-positive
food I-positive
, O
this O
is O
one O
of O
the O
best O
spots O
. O

As O
a O
Japanese O
native O
, O
I O
've O
lived O
in O
the O
Tristate O
area O
for O
over O
8 O
years O
, O
but O
I O
was O
just O
so O
amazed O
at O
this O
place B-positive
. O

I O
can O
not O
imagine O
a O
friendlier O
staff B-positive
working O
in O
a O
restaurant O
. O

I O
've O
always O
found O
the O
wait O
staff O
and O
, O
if O
you O
sit O
at O
the O
bar O
, O
the O
cooks B-positive
very O
friendly O
. O

Newegg O

RMA B-positive
service I-positive
was O
great O
as O
always O
, O
I O
contacted O
them O
late O
Friday O
night O

and O
they O
issued O
me O
an O
RMA O
number O
and O
a O
PrePaid O
UPS O

label O
the O
very O
next O
morning O
on O
Saturday O

They O
have O
wheat O
crusted O
pizza O
made O
with O
really O
fresh O
and O
yummy O
ingredients B-positive

Great O
atmoshere B-positive
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

Delicate O
spices B-positive
, O
onions B-positive
, O
eggs B-positive
and O
a O
kick-ass O
roti B-positive
. O

Great O
atmoshere B-positive
and O
worth O
every O
bit O
. O

From O
the O
build B-negative
quality I-negative
to O
the O
performance B-negative
, O
everything O
about O
it O
has O
been O
sub-par O
from O
what O
I O
would O
have O
expected O
from O
Apple O
. O

The O
battery B-positive
is O
really O
long O
. O

I O
trust O
the O
people B-positive
at O
Go O
Sushi O
, O
it O
never O
disappoints O
. O

Laptops O
are O
usually O
used O
on O
the O
go O
, O
so O
why O
not O
give O
you O
a O
better O
battery B-negative
? O

The O
red B-negative
curry I-negative
is O
weak O
and O
tasteless O
, O
the O
pad B-negative
thai I-negative
is O
stuck O
together O
and O
lumpy O
, O
the O
rice B-negative
is O
often O
overcooked O
, O
and O
the O
seafood B-negative
is O
pretty O
sketchy O
. O

Everything O
about O
the O
Mac O
is O
not O
only O
visually O
appealing O
, O
but O
very O
easy O
to O
use B-positive
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
very O
good O
and O
I O
was O
pleasantly O
surprised O
to O
see O
so O
many O
vegan B-positive
options I-positive
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
the O
only O
thing O
good O
about O
this O
restaurant O
. O

Coming O
from O
Boston O
this O
place O
is O
like O
Emma O
's O
Pizza O
in O
Kendall O
Square O
in O
Cambridge O
( O
although O
they O
have O
more O
funky O
toppings B-positive
! O
) O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
how O
long O
the O
battery B-positive
lasted O
on O
a O
single O
charge B-positive
. O

When O
you O
're O
sitting O
in O
their O
main B-positive
dining I-positive
room I-positive
( O
which O
has O
a O
spectacular O
, O
hand-painted O
high O
ceiling B-positive
) O
you O
'd O
never O
know O
there O
was O
a O
world O
outside O
. O

Its O
location B-positive
is O
good O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
Hutner O
College O
is O
near O
and O
their O
prices B-positive
are O
very O
reasonable O
, O
makes O
students O
go O
back O
to O
Suan O
again O
and O
again O
. O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
dislike O
about O
this O
laptop O
are O
the O
rubber B-negative
pads I-negative
found O
on O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
computer O
for O
grip O
. O

The O
second O
you O
walk O
through O
the O
heavy O
vault O
like O
door B-neutral
, O
with O
people O
anticipating O
your O
arrival O
you O
get O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
are O
going O
to O
have O
the O
dining O
ride O
of O
a O
lifetime O
. O

Delicious O
crab B-positive
cakes I-positive
too O
. O

but O
the O
service B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
. O

First O
the O
wrong O
bread B-negative
came O
out O
with O
the O

The O
food B-positive

great O

they O
make O
a O
mean O
bloody B-positive
mary I-positive
. O

I O
definitely O
enjoyed O
the O
food B-positive
as O
well O
. O

love O
the O
food B-positive
. O

The O
staff B-negative
should O
be O
a O
bit O
more O
friendly O
. O

Its O
ease O
of O
use B-positive
and O
the O
top O
service B-positive
from O
Apple- O
be O
it O
their O

assistance I-positive
or O
bellying O
up O
to O
the O

can O
not O
be O
beat O

This O
dish B-positive
is O
my O
favorite O
and O
I O
always O
get O
it O
when O
I O
go O
there O
and O
never O
get O
tired O
of O
it O

add O

a O
refreshing O
ice B-positive

for O
$ O
2 O
and O
you O
're O
set O
for O
the O
night O
! O

There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
purchase O
virus B-positive
protection I-positive
for I-positive
Mac I-positive
, O
which O
saves O
me O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
and O
money O
. O

I O
am O
not O
a O
vegetarian O
but O
, O
almost O
all O
the O
dishes B-positive
were O
great O
. O

I O
wiped O
nearly O
everything O
off O
of O
it O
, O
installed O
OpenOffice O
and O
Firefox O
, O
and O
I O
am O
operating O
an O
incredibly O
efficient O
and O
useful O
machine O
for O
a O
great O
price B-positive
. O

Apparently O
there O
is O
a O
manufacturing O
defect O
, O
something O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
thermal B-negative
paste I-negative
. O

Good O

I O
LOVE O
their O
spicy O
scallop B-positive
roll I-positive
, O
and O
my O
boyfriend O
consistently O
gets O
the O
sesame O
chicken O
. O

The O
service B-negative
is O
awful O
-- O
the O
last O
time O
I O
was O
there O
( O
and O
I O
do O
mean O
the O
last O
time O
) O
we O
were O
told O
that O
they O
needed O
our O
table O
so O
we O
would O
have O
to O
leave O
. O

I O
have O
been O
to O
Rao B-positive
's I-positive
probably O
15 O
times O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
and O
it O
keeps O
getting O
better O
. O

The O
food O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
a O
little O
flavorless O
and O
the O
portions B-negative
very O
small O
, O
including O
dessert B-negative
. O

Then O
after O
4 O
or O
so O
months O
the O
charger B-negative
stopped O
working O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
go O
out O
and O
buy O
new O
hardware B-negative
just O
to O
keep O
this O
computer O
running O
. O

When O
he O
finally O
did O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
make O
a O
gin B-neutral
and I-neutral
tonic I-neutral
-- O
could O
n't O
find O
tonic O
. O

If O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
good O
quality O
, O
cheap O
eats B-positive
- O
this O
is O
the O
place O
. O

The O
lobster B-negative
knuckles I-negative
( O
special O
of O
the O
day O
) O
were O
ok O
, O
but O
pretty O
tasteless O
. O

I O
actually O
had O
the O
hard B-negative
drive I-negative
replaced O
twice O
, O
the O
mother B-negative
board I-negative
once O
, O
the O
dvd B-negative
drive I-negative
twice O
, O
then O
they O
FINALLY O
agreed O
to O
replace O
it O
, O
( O
ALL O
OF O
THIS O
IN O
LESS O
THAN O
1 O
1/2 O
YEARS O
! O

Try O
green B-positive
curry I-positive
with I-positive
vegetables I-positive
. O

My O
son O
and O
his O
girlfriend O
both O
wanted O
cheeseburgers B-neutral
and O
they O
were O
huge O
! O

There O
is O
no O
cd B-negative
drive I-negative
on O
the O
computer O
, O
which O
defeats O
the O
purpose O
of O
keeping O
files O
on O
a O
cd O
. O

We O
came O
across O
this O
restaurant O
by O
accident O
while O
at O
a O
DUMBO O
art O
festival O
and O
thoroughly O
enjoyed O
our O
meal B-positive
. O

While O
the O
food B-positive
was O
excellent O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
cheap O
( O
though O
not O
extremely O
expensive O
either O
) O
. O

Poor O
service B-negative
and O
management B-negative

After O
a O
little O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
owning O
my O
MacBook O
Pro O
, O
the O
monitor B-negative
has O
completely O
died O
. O

While O
there O
's O
a O
decent O
menu B-positive
, O
it O
should O
n't O
take O
ten O
minutes O
to O
get O
your O
drinks O
and O
45 O
for O
a O
dessert O
pizza O
. O

The O
ambience B-positive
is O
pretty O
and O
nice O
for O
conversation O
, O
so O
a O
casual O
lunch O
here O
would O
probably O
be O
best O
. O

All O
of O
the O
apetizers B-positive
are O
good O
and O
the O
Sangria B-positive
is O
very O
good O
. O

The O
staff B-negative
is O
arrogant O
, O
the O
prices B-negative
are O
way O
high O
for O
Brooklyn O
. O

I O
have O
experienced O
no O
problems O
, O
works B-positive
as O
anticipated O
. O

For O
a O
savory O
take O
on O
the O
soup B-positive
and I-positive
sandwich I-positive
meal I-positive
, O
try O
the O
hot B-positive
and I-positive
sour I-positive
soup I-positive
. O

The O
food B-positive
and O
service B-positive
were O
fine O
, O
however O
the O
maitre-D B-negative
was O
incredibly O
unwelcoming O
and O
arrogant O
. O

Their O
tuna B-positive
tartar I-positive
appetizer I-positive
is O
to O
die O
for O
. O

THe O
Pizza B-positive
and O
wine B-positive
were O
excellent O
-- O
the O
service B-positive
too O
-- O
but O
what O
really O
MADE O
this O
place O
was O
the O
backyard O
dining O
area O
. O

Yes O
, O
the O
place B-negative
is O
classy O
and O
beautiful O
, O
but O
they O
most O
certainly O
target O
the O
uber O
whealthy O
Not O
the O
common O
joe O
that O
wants O
to O
go O
all O
out O
every O
once O
in O
a O
while O
. O

Prices B-neutral
are O
in O
line O
. O

Well O
, O
this O
place B-negative
is O
so O
Ghetto O
its O
not O
even O
funny O
. O

Not O
too O
much O
so O
, O
but O
enough O
that O
there O
's O
a O
great O
scene B-positive
. O

The O
food B-negative
was O
delicious O
but O
do O
not O
come O
here O
on O
a O
empty O
stomach O
. O

Serves O
really O
good O
sushi B-positive

The O
food B-positive
is O
great O
( O
big O
selection B-positive
, O
reasonable O
prices B-positive
) O
and O
the O
drinks B-positive
are O
really O
good O

2nd O
Best O
computer O
in O
the O
world O
only O
one O
way O
this O
computer O
might O
become O
the O
best O
is O
that O
it O
needs O
to O
upgreade O
patches B-negative
to O
make O
less O
easier O
for O
people O
to O
hack O
into O

Service B-negative
was O
also O
horrible O
and O
the O
ambience B-negative
is O
not O
that O
great O
. O

I O
had O
the O
duck B-positive
breast I-positive
special I-positive
on O
my O
last O
visit O
and O
it O
was O
incredible O
. O

This O
is O
the O
BEST O
Shabu-Shabu B-positive
Restaurant I-positive
in O
the O
Try-State O
Area O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
worth O
an O
one-hour O
drive O
. O

Disappointingly O
, O
their O
wonderful O
Saketini B-positive
has O
been O
taken O
off O
the O
bar B-negative
menu I-negative
. O

It O
is O
loaded O
with O
programs B-negative
that O
is O
of O
no O
good O
for O
the O
average O
user O
, O
that O
makes O
it O
run B-negative
way O
to O
slow O
. O

Chow B-negative
fun I-negative
was O
dry O
; O
pork B-negative
shu I-negative
mai I-negative
was O
more O
than O
usually O
greasy O
and O
had O
to O
share O
a O
table O
with O
loud O
and O
rude O
family O
. O

The O
hostess B-positive
was O
very O
pleasant O
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
terrible O
, O
we O
had O
to O
wait O
for O
everything O
and O
ask O
several O
of O
different O
people O
for O
the O
same O
thing O
before O
we O
were O
allowed O
to O
be O
served O
. O

Service B-negative
ok O
but O
unfriendly O
, O
filthy O
bathroom B-negative
. O

I O
've O
enjoyed O
99 O
% O
of O
the O
dishes B-positive
we O
've O
ordered O
with O
the O
only O
exceptions O
being O
the O
occasional O
too-authentic-for-me O
dish B-negative
( O
I O
'm O
a O
daring O
eater O
but O
not O
THAT O
daring O
) O
. O

the O
i3 B-positive
processor I-positive
does O
n't O
seem O
to O
run O
hot O
and O
the O
fan B-positive
rarely O
turns O
on O
. O

Many O
of O
my O
classmates O
computers O
hard B-negative
drives I-negative
crashed O
. O

This O
place B-positive
is O
really O
trendi O
but O
they O
have O
forgotten O
about O
the O
most O
important O
part O
of O
a O
restaurant O
, O
the O
food B-negative
. O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
how O
quiet O
the O
hard B-positive
drive I-positive
is O
and O
how O
quick O
this O
thing O
boots B-positive
up I-positive
. O

the O
service B-positive
is O
prompt O

. O

In O
the O
shop O
, O
these O
MacBooks O
are O
encased O
in O
a O
soft O
rubber B-positive
enclosure I-positive
- O
so O
you O
will O
never O
know O
about O
the O
razor O
edge O
until O
you O
buy O
it O
, O
get O
it O
home O
, O
break O
the O
seal O
and O
use O
it O
( O
very O
clever O

. O

little O
short O

but O
you O
get O
what O
you O
pay O
for O

I O
already O
have O
a O
HP O
laptop O
I O
bought O
last O
year O
that O

standard O

Externally O
the O
keys B-negative
on O
my O
keyboard B-negative
are O
falling O
off O
, O
after O
a O
few O
uses O
the O
paint B-negative
is O
rubbing O
off O
the O

below I-negative
the I-negative

and O
where O
the O
heals O
of O
my O
hands O
sit O
, O
and O
the O
screen B-negative
has O
a O
terrible O

Best O
of O
all O
is O
the O
warm O
vibe B-positive
, O
the O
owner B-positive
is O
super O
friendly O
and O
service B-positive
is O
fast O
. O

I O
only O
tried O
a O
simple O
dish O
of O
spinach B-positive
ravioli I-positive
in I-positive
a I-positive
light I-positive
oil I-positive
and I-positive
garlic I-positive
sauce I-positive
, O
but O
it O
actually O
faired O
better O
than O
most O
NYC O
Italian O
joints O
I O
've O
tried O
similar O
dishes O
at O
. O

The O
best O
dessert B-positive
, O
a O
chocolate O
and O
peanut O
butter O
tart O
, O
is O
n't O
particularly O
Hawaiian O
, O
but O
it O
's O
a O
small O
world O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
sweets O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
good O
. O

But O
the O
quality B-negative
, O
in O
general O
was O
less O
than O
the O
worth O
of O
the O
cheap O
laptop O
. O

They O
gave O
me O
a O
hard O
time O
yet O
again O
, O
but O
their O
was O
a O
malfunction O
in O
the O
battery B-negative
itself O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
die O
. O

Dahkin O
also O
offers O

which O
was O
prompt O

knowledgable O

likeable O

This O
place O
has O
the O
best O
Chinese O

city O
. O

my O
personal O
favorite O
is O
an O
everything O
bagel B-positive

all O
the O

unbeliavably O

By O

, O
the O
best O

The O

The O
food B-neutral

not O
any O
better O
than O
what O
you O

at O
a O
good O
neighborhood O
restaurant O

I O
must O
say O
it O
's O
a O
little O
pricey O
for O
the O
food B-negative
because O
it O
was O
not O

spectacular O
as O

think O
this O

a O

It O

The O
smaller O

the O
fact O
that O

bad O

the O

The O

Consequently O
, O
their O

made O
such O

After O

the O

the O

seem O

what O

that O
the O

so O
they O
installed O
a O
new O

Too O
bad O
the O

not O
too O

The O
portions B-negative
are O
small O
but O
being O
that O
the O
food B-positive
was O
so O
good O
makes O
up O
for O
that O
. O

This O
is O
likely O
due O
to O
poor O
grounding O

isolation O
between O
the O
components B-negative

and O
I O
'm O
hoping O
that O
it O
can O
be O
fixed O
with O
a O
ground O

I O
still O
expected O
better O
product O
quality B-negative

about O

imagine O
how O
dreadful O
it O

it O
we O
only O
had O
to O

an O

The O
manager O
came O
to O
the O
table O

said O
we O

what O

we O
did O

the O

the O

very O

The O
main O
downside O

I O
have O
been O
going O
to O
this O

in O
the O
past O
the O
service B-neutral
was O
average O

the O

inconsistant O

If O
you O
go O

try O
the O
marinara/arrabiatta B-positive

the O

I O
should O
have O
just O
asked O
for O
the O
check O
when O
I O
saw O
that O
; O
but O
their O
menu B-positive
was O
so O
unique O
that O
I O
continued O

love O
the O
food B-positive
. O

The O
service B-negative
was O
a O
bit O
slow O
and O
the O
portions B-negative
are O
a O
bit O
small O
so O
if O
you O
are O
hungry O
and O
in O
a O
rush O
, O
this O
is O
not O
the O

for O
you O

All O
I O
can O
say O

$ O
2 O

the O
some O
of O
the O
cheapest O

but O
in O
this O
unattractive O

But O
they O

The O

should O
be O
larger O

to O
justify O
the O
expense O
even O

I O
've O
been O
to O
at O
Cafe B-positive
Spice I-positive
probably O
5-8 O
times O
, O
it O
is O
probably O
still O
the O
best O
Indian O
restaurant O
around O
Union O
Square O
. O

However O
, O
the O
experience O
was O
great O
since O
the O
OS B-positive
does O
not O
become O
unstable O
and O
the O
application O
will O
simply O
shutdown O

reopen O

It O
's O
definately O
not O
a O
place B-negative
to O
go O
if O
you O
want O
to O

Not O
only O
did O
they O
have O
amazing O
, O
sandwiches B-positive

, O
but O
their O
homemade B-positive

are O
out O

This O
place B-positive
is O
a O
great O
bargain O

They O
have O
an O
excellent O
selection B-positive
( O
the O
rolls B-positive

They O

out O

The O

In O

all O
the O

All O

the O

the O

the O

we O

The O

The O
quality B-negative

Unlike O
other O
places O
in O
NYC O
where O
the O

you O
want O
only O
come O
as O
a O
triple-decker O
, O
here O
you O
can O
get O
what O
you O
want O
in O
a O
reasonably-sized O

( O

The O
combination O
of O
super-fresh O
ingredients B-positive
in O
the O
dishes O
are O
unusual O

really O
delicious O
. O

The O
battery B-negative

completely O

in O

it O
had O
grown O
about O
a O

I O
also O
like O
the O

these O
were O

only O
two O
things O
I O
liked O
about O

The O
food B-positive
was O
pretty O
tradional O
but O
it O
was O
hot O

Especially O
liked O
chicken B-positive

the O

The O

awful O

We O
were O
worried O
we O
would O
have O
trouble O
getting O
in O
, O
but O
somehow O
managed O
to O
have O
a O
short O
wait B-positive

The O

were O
CHEAP O
compared O
to O
the O

The O
prices B-positive
are O
not O
terrible O
. O

Again O
I O
sent O
it O
back O
and O
they O
replaced O
the O
motherboard B-neutral
and O
some O
fan B-neutral
inside O
. O

I O
have O
to O
say O
I O
have O
never O
had O
a O
disapointing O
meal B-positive
here O
. O

Food B-positive
is O
excellent O

We O
, O
there O
were O
four O
of O
us O
, O
arrived O
at O
noon O
- O
the O
place O
was O
empty O

and O
the O
staff B-negative
acted O
like O
we O
were O
imposing O
on O
them O
and O
they O
were O
very O
rude O
. O

The O
appetizers B-neutral
are O
just O
OK O
and O
the O
main B-negative
courses I-negative
were O
decidedly O
subpar O
. O

The O
food B-positive
was O
great O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
even O
better O
. O

At O
the O
end O
you O
're O
left O
with O
a O
mild O
broth B-positive
with I-positive
noodles I-positive
that O
you O
can O
slurp O
out O
of O
a O
cup O

The O
criticism O

waned O

now O
I O
'd O
be O
the O
first O
to O
recommend O
an O
Air O

The O
best O
thing O
I O
tasted O
were O
the O

A O
great O

: O
one O
can O

The O

the O

that O
extra O
mile O
. O

The O
scallops B-positive
are O
apparently O
cooked O
in O
a O
black O

really O
makes O
them O
unique O
( O
not O

The O

always O
prompt O
, O
though O
the O
restaurant O
does O
fill O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
. O

It O
's O
simply O
the O
best O
meal B-positive
in O
NYC O
. O

Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
space B-positive
is O
large O
, O
they O
've O
overcrowded O
the O
floor O
with O
tables B-negative
. O

I O
also O
love O
the O
small O
, O
convenient O
size B-positive
of O
my O
laptop O
, O
making O
it O
a O
perfect O
tool O
for O
my O
academic O
studies O
. O

Food B-positive
was O
average O
but O
tasty O
. O

This O
laptop O
is O
a O
great O
price B-positive
and O
has O
a O
sleek O
look B-positive
. O

The O
screen B-negative
gets O
smeary O
and O
dusty O
very O
quickly O
and O
it O
's O
very O
noticeable O
. O

The O
environment B-neutral
is O
very O
upscale O
and O
you O
will O
see O
a O
lot O
of O
rich O
guys O
with O
trophy O
wives O
or O
just O
highly O
paid O
escorts O
. O

Great O
Breakfast B-positive

Keyboard B-negative
could O
use O
some O
trimming O
. O

Consequently O
, O
their O
burgers B-negative
fell O
apart O
in O
their O
hands O
and O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
that O
they O
did'nt O
feel O
like O
finishing O
them O
. O

also O
the O
keyboard B-negative
does O
not O
liht O
up O
so O
unless O
your O
sitting O
in O
a O
room O
with O
some O
light O
you O
cant O
see O
anything O
and O
thats O
bad O
for O
me O
because O
my O
boyfriend O
tends O
to O
watch O
tv O
in O
the O
dark O
at O
night O
which O
leaves O
me O
with O
no O
way O
of O
seeing O
the O
keyboard O
. O

As O
well O
as O
having O
the O
plug B-negative
in O
the O
computer O
come O
loose O
. O

sometimes O
i O
get O
bad O
food B-negative
and O
bad O
service B-negative
, O
sometimes O
i O
get O
good O
good B-positive
and O
bad O
service B-negative
. O

The O
whole O
set O
up O
is O
truly O
unprofessional O
and O
I O
wish O
Cafe O
Noir O
would O
get O
some O
good O
staff B-negative
, O
because O
despite O
the O
current O
one O
this O
is O
a O
great O
place O
. O

Only O
issue O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
little O
slow O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
fixing O
that O
by O
adding O
more O
RAM B-neutral

Spreads B-positive
and O
toppings B-positive
are O
great O
- O
though O
a O

pricey O

There O
was O
a O
long O
wait B-negative
for O
a O
table B-neutral
outside O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
little O
too O
hot O
in O
the O
sun O
anyway O
so O
our O
insde B-positive
table I-positive
was O
very O
nice O

Best O
Taiwanese B-positive
food I-positive
in O
NY O
! O

Most O
of O
the O
sandwiches B-positive
are O
made O
with O
soy O
mayonaise O
which O
is O
actually O
pretty O
good O
. O

If O
you O
love O
wine B-positive

cheese B-positive
and O
delicious O
french B-positive

In O
terms O
of O
the O
food B-neutral
itself O
-- O
nothing O
special O
, O
we O
limited O
ourselves O
to O
several O
appetizers B-neutral
. O

working B-positive
with O
Mac O

so O
much O
easier O
, O
so O
many O
cool O

The O

exceptional O

I O
think O
part O
of O
the O
problem O
with O
this O
computer O
is O
Vista B-negative
, O
yet O
I O
know O
Vista O
is O
n't O
the O
entire O
issue O
because O
my O
latest O
purchase O
was O
my O
Acer O
and O
it O
also O
has O

( O
I O
should O
have O
waited O
the O

The O
layout B-negative

One O
would O
think O

complimentary O
drinks O

instead O
, O
we O
got O
a O
snobby O
waiter B-negative
would O
n't O
even O
take O
our O
order O
for O
15 O
minutes O
and O
gave O
us O
lip O
when O
we O
asked O
him O

Cool O
atmosphere B-positive

the O
fire O
place O
in O
the O

a O
bit O
more O
heat O
throughout O

a O
cold O
night O

However O
, O
our O
$ O
14 O

If O

are O
going O
for O

Great O

The O

extremely O
slowly O

Authentic O

what O
more O
could O
you O
ask O

? O

Ingredients B-positive

organic O

is O
a O
real O
plus O
for O
me O
. O

This O
is O
some O
really O
good O
, O
inexpensive O
sushi B-positive
. O

The O
bagels B-positive
always O
warm O
, O
soft O
on O
the O
inside O
, O
crispy O
on O
the O
outside O

enormous O

I O
love O
the O
way O
the O
entire O
suite B-positive
of I-positive
software I-positive
works O
together O
. O

It O
may O
be O
a O
bit O
packed O
on O
weekends O
, O
but O
the O
vibe B-positive
is O
good O
and O
it O
is O
the O
best O
French B-positive
food I-positive
you O
will O
find O
in O
the O
area O
. O

The O
bathroom B-negative
itself O
is O
very O
small O
with O
two O
toilets O
and O
only O
one O
sink O
, O
the O
girl O
was O
staying O
totally O
on O
the O
way O
hanging O
out O
paper O

Ask O

Usha B-positive

Straight-forward O

no O

very O
decent O
Japanese B-positive
food I-positive
. O

The O
flaws O
are O
, O
this O
computer O
is O
not O
for O
computer O
gamers O
because O
of O
the O
OS B-negative
X I-negative
. O

Sure O
, O
the O
initial O
out O
of O
pocket O
expense B-negative
is O
greater O
, O
but O
that O
should O
not O
dissuade O
anyone O
from O
the O
fact O
that O
these O
machines O
run O
like O
none O
other O
on O
the O
planet O
, O
and O
when O
I O
factor O
in O
all O
the O
money O
in O
that O
I O
wasted O
on O
Geek O
Squad O
and O
the O
latest O
patches O
to O
de-corrupt O
my O
infested O
PCs O
, O
it O
probably O
comes O
out O
about O
even O
anyhow O
. O

The O
menu B-negative
is O
very O
limited O
- O
i O
think O
we O
counted O
4 O
or O
5 O
entrees O
. O

The O
food B-positive
is O
so O
cheap O
and O
the O
waiters B-positive
are O
nice O
. O

this O
is O
the O
best O
secret O
place O
in O
midtown O
' O
, O
I O
heard O
that O
from O
the O
bartender O
, O
after O
having O
brilliant O
food B-positive
( O
try O
steak B-positive
with I-positive
portobello I-positive
mushrooms I-positive
) O
and O
drinks B-positive
on O
the O
bar O
last O
Tuesday O
. O

I O
was O
here O
a O
few O
weeks O
back O
and O
we O
had O
the O
worst O
customer B-negative
service I-negative
experience O
at O
a O
restaurant O
ever O
. O

After O
waiting O
for O
almost O
an O
hour O
, O
the O
waiter B-negative
brusquely O
told O
us O
he O
'd O
forgotten O
to O
give O
the O
kitchen O
our O
order O
. O

My O
macbook O
is O
so O
much O
better O
looking B-positive
and O
so O
thin O
! O

After O
replacing O
the O
hard O
drive O
the O
battery B-negative
stopped O
working O
( O
3 O
months O
of O
use O
) O
which O
was O
frustrating O
. O

Also O
kinda O
loud O
when O
the O
fan B-negative
was O
running O
. O

The O
staff B-positive
is O
courteous O
and O
friendly O
. O

You O
must O
have O
the O
crabmeat B-positive
lasagna I-positive
which O
is O
out O
of O
this O
world O
and O
the O
chocolate O
bread O
pudding O
for O
dessert O
. O

The O
reality O
was O
, O
it O
heated O
up O
very O
quickly O
, O
and O
took O
way O
too O
long O
to O
do O
simple O
things O
, O
like O
opening B-negative
my I-negative
Documents I-negative
folder I-negative
. O

This O
place B-negative
is O
not O
inviting O
and O
the O
food B-negative
is O
totally O
weird O
. O

– O
I O
really O
enjoyed O
my O
meal B-positive
here O
. O

The O
fish B-negative
was O
not O
fresh O
and O
the O
rice B-negative
tasted O
old O
and O
stale O
. O

Theres O
a O
built B-positive
in I-positive
camera I-positive
with O
special O
effects- O
for O
video O
and O
photography O
. O

The O
lamb B-negative
meat I-negative
was O
under-cooked O
and O
EXTRMELY O
CHEWY O
. O

I O
liked O
the O
beer B-positive
selection I-positive
! O

I O
custom O
ordered O
the O
machine O
from O
HP O
and O
could O
NOT O
understand O
the O
techie B-negative
due O
to O
his O
accent O
. O

My O
suggestion O
is O
to O
eat B-positive
family I-positive
style I-positive
because O
you O
'll O
want O
to O
try O
the O
other O
dishes O
. O

Traditional B-positive
French I-positive
decour I-positive
was O
pleasant O
though O
the O
hall B-negative
was O
rather O
noisy O
- O
the O
restaurant O
was O
full O
and O
we O
had O
to O
raise O
our O
voices O
to O
be O
able O
to O
maintain O
a O
conversation O
. O

The O
beverages B-positive
were O
excellent O
, O
and O
the O
dessert B-positive
was O
good O
. O

We O
were O
also O
seated O
promptly O
at O
the O
time O
of O
our O
reservation O
and O
the O
service B-positive
was O
very O
quick O
and O
professional O
. O

My O
chicken B-negative
was O
inedible O
as O
there O
were O
so O
many O
fatty O
lumps O
which O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
spitting O
out O
into O
my O
napkin O
. O

The O
lack O
of O
AC B-negative
and O
the O
fact O
that O
there O
are O
a O
million O
swarming O
bodies O
( O
although O
everyone O
is O
polite O
and O
no O
one O
is O
pushing O
) O
is O
a O
slight O
turn O
off O
. O

Our O
server B-positive
continued O
to O
be O
attentive O
throughout O
the O
night O
, O
but O
I O
did O
remain O
puzzled O
by O
one O
issue O
: O
Who O
thinks O
that O
Ray B-neutral
's I-neutral
is O
an O
appropriate O
place O
to O
take O
young O
children O
for O
dinner O
? O

The O
only O
downfall O
is O
the O
volume B-negative
control I-negative
. O

Service B-positive
was O
devine O
, O
oysters B-positive
where O
a O
sensual O
as O
they O
come O
, O
and O
the O
price O
ca O
n't O
be O
beat O
! O
! O
! O

So O
much O
more O
than O
the O
usual O
bar O
food O
, O
go O
there O
to O
enjoy O
the O
menu B-positive
while O
sampling O
one O
of O
their O
hand-crafted B-positive
beers I-positive
. O

My O
friend O
had O
a O
burger O
and O
I O
had O
these O
wonderful O
blueberry B-positive
pancakes I-positive
. O

I O
've O
dined O
at O
Alain O
Ducasse O
's O
restaurant O
in O
Monte O
Carlo O
for O
half O
the O
price O
for O
the O
same O
excellent O
dining B-positive
experience O
. O

The O
place B-positive
was O
nice O
and O
calm O
. O

Battery B-negative
life I-negative
could O
be O
better O
but O
overall O
for O
the O
price B-positive
and O
Toshiba O
's O
reputation O
for O
laptops O
it O
's O
great O
! O

After O
paying O
several O
hundred O
dollars O
for O
this O
service B-negative
, O
it O
is O
frustrating O
that O
you O
can O
not O
get O
help O
after O
hours O
. O

I O
had O
the O
Lamb B-positive
special I-positive
which O
was O
perfect O
. O

If O
I O
could O
rate O
the O
people B-positive
this O
place O
would O
be O
off O
the O
charts O
- O
unfortunately O
- O
the O
pizza B-negative
, O
sorry O
- O
not O
the O
best O
in O

The O
food B-negative
is O
decent O
at O
best O
, O
and O
the O
ambience B-negative

well O
, O
it O
's O
a O
matter O
of O
opinion O
, O
some O
may O
consider O
it O
to O
be O
a O
sweet O
thing O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
annoying O
. O

The O
service B-positive
was O
spectacular O
as O
the O
waiter B-positive
knew O
everything O
about O
the O
menu O
and O
his O
recommendations O
were O
amazing O
! O

I O
recieved O

The O

Their O
sake B-positive
list I-positive

a O
peaceful O

relaxing O
break O
amongst O
all O
the O
kids O
running O
around O
in O
Downtown O
Disney O

The O
portions B-negative

small O
but O

up O
for O

This O

the O

warm O

I O
've O
been O
to O
this O

Pho B-positive
, O
Lemon B-positive
grass I-positive

or O
Beef B-positive
Cube I-positive
on I-positive
rice I-positive
, O

your O
only O
option O
) O
, O
I O
got O
through O
about O

a O
far O
more O
disgusting O
, O
slimy O
, O
clearly O
bad O
piece O
of O
fish O
skin O
. O

The O
music O

very O
hip O

sound I-negative
system I-negative
was O
located O
under O

annoying O
midway O
through O

While O
this O
is O
n't O
classical O
restaurant O
fare O
, O
the O
chef O
has O
given O
new O
life O
to O
an O

with O
some O
really O
innovative O
and O
tasty O
dishes B-positive
that O
are O
genuinely O
Indian B-positive
without O

The O

dish I-positive

The O

such O
a O
