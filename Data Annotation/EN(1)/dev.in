Green
Tea
creme
brulee
is
a
must
!

It
seemed
to
be
a
very
nice
laptop
except
I
was
not
able
to
load
my
Garmin
GPS
software
or
Microsoft
Office
2003
.

Charger
seems
large
for
this
class
of
computer
.

Made
interneting
(
part
of
my
business
)
very
difficult
to
maintain
.

Right
size
and
weight
for
portability
.

Best
drumsticks
over
rice
and
sour
spicy
soup
in
town
!

Only
2
usb
ports
...
seems
kind
of
...
limited
.

Considering
we
were
the
last
patrons
there
and
it
was
after
the
closing
time
,
the
waitstaff
did
not
rush
us
at
all
and
made
us
feel
comfortable
and
relaxed
.

Drivers
updated
ok
but
the
BIOS
update
froze
the
system
up
and
the
computer
shut
down
.

By
the
time
we
left
our
wallets
were
empy
and
so
were
our
stomachs
AND
we
missed
the
show
we
were
supposed
to
see
following
our
dinner
,
which
would
have
been
acceptable
if
we
got
to
enjoy
the
experience
of
good
food
and
belly
dancers
!

The
pasta
was
well
cooked
,
did
n't
have
enough
sauce
though
or
flavor
.

Single
Worst
Restaurant
in
Manhattan

The
neat
and
organized
icon
list
is
a
welcome
change
from
cluttered
and
confusing
desktop
icons
.

The
boutique
selection
of
wines
covers
a
wide
variety
without
being
imposeing
.

The
sauce
is
zesty
and
flavorful
and
the
crust
is
nice
and
crispy
.

Food
was
good
and
the
view
of
the
new
york
city
skiline
was
terrific
even
on
a
foggy
rainy
day
like
that
of
when
I
went
.

the
size
of
has
actually
help
me
out
quite
a
bit
by
me
being
able
to
fit
it
in
an
already
full
backpack
and
to
use
it
at
a
resturant
where
the
food
on
the
table
is
always
so
space
consuming
.

The
programs
that
come
standard
with
the
Leopard
running
system
are
enough
for
the
average
person
to
run
all
the
basics
.

If
you
want
something
really
different
than
try
Jekyll
and
Hyde
.

The
aluminum
body
sure
makes
it
stand
out
.

Great
Atmosphere

There
were
small
problems
with
Mac
office
.

Over
time
,
the
food
quality
has
decreased
substantially
,
it
is
a
lot
less
crowded
than
it
used
to
,
and
the
service
must
definitely
be
part
of
the
reason
.

The
staff
ignored
my
friends
and
I
the
entire
time
we
were
there
.

Great
food
,
good
size
menu
,
great
service
and
an
unpretentious
setting
.

We
ended
the
dinner
with
a
surprisingly
light
and
flaky
apple
tarte
tatin
.

I
CAN
EAT
HERE
EVERY
DAY
OF
THE
WEEK
REALLY
LOL
LOVE
THIS
PLACE
...
)

The
skillfully
chosen
Portuguese
cheese
cart
paired
with
quality
port
provides
the
perfect
Iberian
ending
.

For
desserts
,
we
tried
the
frozen
black
sesame
mousse
(
interesting
but
not
extraordinary
)
and
matcha
(
powdered
green
tea
)
and
blueberry
cheesecake
,
which
was
phenomenal
.

The
first
time
I
went
,
and
was
completely
taken
by
the
live
jazz
band
and
atmosphere
,
I
ordered
the
Lobster
Cobb
Salad
.

The
wait
staff
is
pleasant
,
fun
,
and
for
the
most
part
gorgeous
(
in
the
wonderful
aesthetic
beautification
way
,
not
in
that
she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b
@

.

The
acer
one
computer
that
I
bought
is
17
ince
screen
and
its
hard
to
find
lap
top
bags
for
it
,
but
I
like
the
big
screen
on
it
.

This
place
is
not
worth
the
prices
.

Windows
7
Starter
is
terrific
(
no
you
ca
n't
change
the
background
)
but
I
do
n't
need
to
,
I
use
it
just
for
school
work
.

The
lunch
buffet
is
expensive
but
is
deff
worth
it
.

Service
is
not
exactly
five
star
,
but
thats
not
really
a
big
deal
.

The
in-house
lady
DJ
on
Saturday
nights
has
outrageously
good
taste
in
music
,
and
moreover
,
takes
requests
.

even
the
wine
by
the
glass
was
good
.

The
wine
list
is
extensive
,
well
priced
and
covers
alot
of
regions
.

After
replacing
the
hard
drive
the
battery
stopped
working
(
3
months
of
use
)
which
was
frustrating
.

this
is
still
one
of
my
most
favorite
restaurants
in
the
area
the
food
is
inexpensive
but
very
good
(
kimono
shrimp
special
was
excellent
)
and
has
a
great
atmosphere
.

the
headphone
and
mic
jack
are
in
front
of
touch-pad
making
the
touch-pad
hard
to
use
when
using
headphones/mic
,
not
to
mention
the
laptop
was
designed
for
right
handed
person
.

The
staff
is
incredibly
helpful
and
attentive
.

Not
one
of
our
meals
was
edible
-
bland
and/or
made
with
weird
rosemary
or
orange
flavoring
.

everything
is
scrumptious
,
from
the
excellent
service
by
cute
waitresses
,
to
the
extremely
lush
atmosphere
.

Cozy
romantic
atomosphere
with
only
around
15
tables
at
most
.

I
had
upgraded
my
old
MacBook
to
Lion
,
so
I
kind
of
knew
what
I
was
getting
,
but
had
n't
been
able
to
enjoy
some
of
the
awesome
new
multi-touch
features
.

I
had
the
Thai
style
Fried
Sea
Bass
...
which
was
very
good
.

For
my
entr
&
eacute
;
e
,
I
completely
enjoyed
the
seared
Alaskan
sea
scallops
complemented
by
chard
,
artichoke
hearts
,
fennel
,
and
pecorino
toscano
.

Definitely
a
great
spot
for
a
nice
occasion
or
date
.

The
have
a
great
cocktail
with
Citrus
Vodka
and
lemon
and
lime
juice
and
mint
leaves
that
is
to
die
for
!

The
place
is
beautiful
!

even
the
wine
by
the
glass
was
good
.

Customization
on
mac
is
impossible
.

Also
,
HDD
secures
inside
using
rails
,
and
there
is
only
one
set
on
the
main
hard
drive
.

Needs
a
CD/DVD
drive
and
a
bigger
power
switch
.

I
also
really
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
the
decor
and
intimate
feeling
of
a
small
restaurant
.

The
rice
to
fish
ration
was
also
good
--
they
did
n't
try
to
overpack
the
rice
.

The
staff
is
very
good
.

I
had
the
cod
with
paella
(
spicy
and
very
filling
,
I
'm
a
big
eater
and
could
only
eat
half
)
while
my
boyfriend
had
the
classic
fish
and
chips
(
again
,
a
big
serving
-
at
least
5
pieces
of
fish
and
a
basketful
of
fries
)
.

Spreads
and
toppings
are
great
-
though
a
bit
pricey
.

When
we
sat
,
we
got
great
and
fast
service
.

The
appetizers
are
also
delicious
!

Slightly
above
average
wines
start
at
$
70+
with
only
one
selection
listed
at
$
30+
.

I
spoke
with
a
service
rep
at
Micro
Center
and
his
girlfriend
is
having
the
same
problem
with
her
power
adapter
,
so
it
's
not
just
an
isolated
incident
!
!
!

Endless
fun
,
awesome
music
,
great
staff
!
!
!

the
turkey
burgers
are
scary
!

The
service
is
good
and
ambience
is
good
for
a
date
or
group
outing
.

I
would
not
recommend
this
to
anyone
wanting
a
notebook
expecting
the
performance
of
a
Desktop
it
does
not
meet
the
expectations
.

The
screen
is
very
large
and
crystal
clear
with
amazing
colors
and
resolution
.

With
Windows
laptops
a
wireless
mouse
is
an
absolute
must
.

Another
Great
thing
is
the
Beast
graphics
.

However
,
being
foodies
,
we
were
utterly
disappointed
with
the
food
.

Apple
no
longer
includes
iDVD
with
the
computer
and
furthermore
,
Apple
does
n't
even
offer
it
anymore
!

Its
a
nice
quiet
location
to
go
eat
a
good
meal
,
relax
,
be
able
to
talk
and
have
a
very
good
time
.

It
rarely
works
and
when
it
does
it
's
incredibly
slow
.

My
friends
settled
for
rice
dishes
,
but
we
came
back
the
following
day
to
try
the
dim
sum
,
which
was
good
...
not
outstanding
,
but
good
.

I
plan
to
come
here
again
and
look
forward
to
trying
their
assortment
of
bruschetta
,
panini
's
...
..

Wonderful
zooming
.

Everything
about
this
restaurant
was
special
.

Oh
yeah
,
do
n't
forget
the
expensive
shipping
to
and
from
HP
.

We
were
drawn
into
the
belly
dancing
show
that
captivated
the
crowd
.

!
Excellent
performance
,
usability
,
presentation
and
time
response
.

It
is
fast
and
i
have
not
had
a
problem
with
internet
connection
or
any
other
problems
.

Result
(
red
velvet
)
:
Great
texture
,
soft
and
velvety
,
nice
hint
of
cocoa
.

They
also
have
a
great
assortment
of
wraps
if
your
not
in
the
mood
for
traditional
Mediterranean
fare
.

Try
the
Pad
Thai
,
it
's
fabulous
and
their
prices
are
so
cheap
!

Each
time
we
've
been
,
the
front
of
house
staff
(
not
the
waiters
-
they
're
fantastic
-
but
the
people
who
greet
and
seat
you
)
has
been
so
hideous
to
us
that
were
it
not
for
the
exceptional
fish
dishes
I
would
never
return
.

I
also
ordered
the
Change
Mojito
,
which
was
out
of
this
world
.

Fish
was
overdone
.

Worse
of
all
,
$
60
was
erroneously
added
to
our
$
80
bill
.

This
place
is
charming
and
relaxing
.

But
the
thing
that
my
wife
and
I
hated
was
it
was
so
loud
and
it
felt
like
'
bar
'
or
'
pub
'
.

If
you
are
in
search
of
the
most
authentic
NYC
deli
experience
look
no
further
than
the
famous
and
historic
Katz
's
Deli
down
on
the
Lower
East
Side
.

I
was
highly
disappointed
by
their
service
and
food
.

The
specs
are
pretty
good
too
.

Each
table
has
a
pot
of
boiling
water
sunken
into
its
surface
,
and
you
get
platters
of
thin
sliced
meats
,
various
vegetables
,
and
rice
and
glass
noodles
.

Good
food
.

The
spicy
tuna
and
salmon
are
the
best
we
've
ever
had
.

The
food
is
not
what
it
once
was
(
potions
have
seriously
seen
downsizing
)
prices
have
gone
up
,
and
the
service
is
the
worst
I
have
experienced
anywhere
(
including
mainland
Europe
)
.

The
lobster
sandwich
is
good
and
the
spaghetti
with
Scallops
and
Shrimp
is
great
.

One
of
us
actually
liked
the
expresso
-
that
's
it
.

The
Apple
applications
(
ex
.
iPhoto
)
are
fun
,
easy
,
and
really
cool
to
use
(
unlike
the
competition
)
!

I
recently
went
to
this
restaurant
with
some
co-workers
for
lunch
and
had
an
amazing
time
.

The
fish
was
not
fresh
and
the
rice
tasted
old
and
stale
.

This
place
is
pricey
,
and
yes
,
the
food
is
worth
it
;
but
the
service
makes
you
feel
like
you
should
be
paying
a
quater
of
the
price
.

service
is
friendly
,
and
never
had
a
problem
walking
in
and
getting
a
table
.

the
waitstaffs
are
nice
though
.

I
was
taught
to
use
Photoshop
and
was
amazed
.

While
the
place
is
not
a
hotspot
hangout
,
the
drinks
are
unique
and
pack
a
lot
of
bang
for
the
buck
.

THe
perfect
spot
.

Orsay
,
is
without
a
doubt
one
of
the
best
values
for
authentic
French
food
in
NYC
.

We
asked
for
sides
which
the
waiter
than
admitted
that
he
forgot
to
put
in
that
part
of
our
order
.

Premium
price
for
the
OS
more
than
anything
else
.

Service
is
not
what
one
would
expect
from
a
joint
in
this
price
category
.

but
,
the
filet
mignon
was
not
very
good
at
all
cocktail
hour
includes
free
appetizers
(
nice
non-sushi
selection
)
.

It
was
not
clear
that
the
Microsoft
Student
Edition
that
was
loaded
on
the
computer
,
was
a
six
month
trial
.

Other
installed
features
,
such
as
certain
printer
software
,
are
also
most
attractive
.

I
have
been
to
Roth
's
twice
and
both
times
were
very
disappointing
.

I
am
relatively
new
to
the
area
and
tried
Pick
a
bgel
on
2nd
and
was
disappointed
with
the
service
and
I
thought
the
food
was
overated
and
on
the
pricey
side
.

The
food
is
reliable
and
the
price
is
moderate
.

It
's
a
great
product
for
a
great
price
!

great
service

Food
was
okay
,
nothing
great
.

The
touch
pad
is
among
the
best
.

Quite
frankly
,
this
is
some
of
the
worst
sushi
I
have
ever
tried
.

I
have
had
no
problems
with
it
unlike
some
hardware
defects
on
past
models
.

Oh
,
and
the
complimentary
pudding
dessert
was
just
enough
-
yummy
!

I
recommend
the
garlic
shrimp
,
okra
(
bindi
)
,
and
anything
with
lamb
.

The
menu
is
interesting
and
quite
reasonably
priced
.

Cornelia
Street
looks
like
a
Broadway
set
for
West
Side
Story
and
the
inside
of
Po
is
so
cool
quaint
you
really
ca
n't
top
the
setting
for
a
romantic
dinner
in
NYC
.

The
happy
hour
is
so
cheap
,
but
that
does
not
reflect
the
service
or
the
atmosphere
.

I
had
to
re-install
Windows
within
two
weeks
of
the
purchase
and
soon
discovered
cracks
in
the
screen
hinges
.

We
ended
our
great
experience
by
having
Gulab
Jamun
(
dessert
)
recommended
by
the
waiter
.

The
veal
was
incredible
last
night
.

I
'm
already
hooked
on
the
sleek
look
and
dependability
that
this
laptop
has
shown
.

the
atmosphere
is
very
nice
,
and
a
welcome
escape
from
the
rest
of
the
SI
mall
.

The
service
is
decent
even
when
this
small
place
is
packed
.

Decor
is
charming
.

Over
all
it
was
a
very
nice
romantic
place
.

I
'd
highly
recommend
it
for
a
special
occasion
--
it
provides
and
intimate
setting
and
nice
service
.

Highly
recommended
is
the
Spicy
Fried
Clam
Rolls
and
Spider
Rolls
.

Everything
about
this
restaurant
was
special
.

This
place
has
the
best
Chinese
style
BBQ
ribs
in
the
city
.

Best
Reuben
sandwich
ever
!

There
was
no
tap
beer
that
evening
,
which
was
a
disappointment
.

Enjoy
using
Microsoft
Office
!

great

THE
BIG
COMPLAINT
:
NO
TOASTING
AVAILABLE
.

My
favorite
part
of
this
computer
is
that
it
has
a
vga
port
so
I
can
connect
it
to
a
bigger
screen
.

great
meal
–
the
fish
on
the
omikase
platter
was
absolutely
decadent
--
there
was
none
of
the
stringiness
that
sometimes
accompanies
fair
sushi
--
this
fish
was
perfect
!
!
!
!

The
staff
has
always
been
friendly
without
seeming
grating
,
and
the
chef
has
greeted
us
on
a
couple
of
occasions
.

the
hot
dogs
were
juicy
and
tender
inside
and
had
plenty
of
crunch
and
snap
on
the
outside
.

Give
it
a
try
,
menu
is
typical
French
but
varied
.

We
are
very
particular
about
sushi
and
were
both
please
with
every
choice
which
included
:
ceviche
mix
(
special
)
,
crab
dumplings
,
assorted
sashimi
,
sushi
and
rolls
,
two
types
of
sake
,
and
the
banana
tempura
.

I
would
definitely
recommend
SEA
if
you
like
thai
cuisine
!

The
battery
is
not
as
shown
in
the
product
photos
.

You
just
can
not
beat
the
functionality
of
an
Apple
device
.

Excellent
food
,
nice
ambience
,
fairly
expensive

The
wine
the
service
was
very
good
too
.

The
entree
was
also
very
good
.

We
took
advanatage
of
the
half
price
sushi
deal
on
saturday
so
it
was
well
worth
it
.

The
menu
is
great
,
with
a
good
selection
,
and
everything
that
I
have
tried
is
absolutely
delicious
.

The
food
really
is
n't
very
good
and
the
service
is
terrible
.

lightweight
,
long
battery
life
,
excellent
transition
from
PC
;

The
food
is
very
good
and
the
service
is
great
.

Well
designed
and
fast
.

Very
fast
boot
up
and
shut
down
.

It
is
a
REAL
touchpad
,
not
the
toy
I
saw
in
other
brands
.

The
unattractive
lighting
made
me
want
to
gag
,
the
food
was
overpriced
,
there
was
the
most
awful
disco
pop
duo
performing-and
my
escargot
looked
like
it
might
crawl
off
the
plate
.

Ambience
is
so
cute
and
quaint
,
good
for
business
although
we
were
there
on
vacation
.

the
touch
pad
is
fine
-
again
,
it
's
a
real
touch
pad
.

The
prices
are
about
$
9
for
an
entree
for
dinner
and
even
less
for
lunch
.

Very
romantic
fires
-
I
've
literally
spent
hours
at
Lanterna
,
drinking
wine
from
their
extensive
wine
and
enjoying
the
ambience
.

Average
to
good
Thai
food
,
but
terrible
delivery
.

It
was
totally
overpriced
-
fish
and
chips
was
about
$
15
...
.

The
food
was
actually
aweful
.

The
service
was
quick
and
friendly
.

It
's
easy
to
get
a
table
for
a
large
group
and
you
do
n't
get
hustled
out
.

LOVE
the
atmosphere
-
felt
like
I
was
in
Paris
.

good
sake
selection
.

Casablanca
servces
delicious
falafel
,
tabouleh
,
humus
and
other
Mediterranean
delights
,
which
are
all
very
inexpensive
.

Bison
was
quite
excellent
however
.

Not
a
small
feat
for
good
french
food
in
the
area
.

I
have
been
coming
here
for
years
and
have
nothing
but
good
things
to
say
about
the
service
and
the
great
staff
at
La
Lanterna
.

The
food
was
bland
oily
.

I
highly
recommend
the
grand
marnier
shrimp
,
it
's
insanely
good
.

The
Four
Seasons
restaurant
is
a
great
experience
.

But
the
thai
is
definitely
not
great
--
bland
and
undistinguished
.

Unbeatable
sushi
!

I
had
the
duck
breast
special
on
my
last
visit
and
it
was
incredible
.

Even
though
the
computer
is
larger
they
did
not
make
the
keyboard
larger
.

To
celebrate
a
birthday
,
three
of
us
went
to
Mare
anticipating
great
food
.

If
your
looking
for
nasty
high
priced
food
with
a
dash
of
ghetto
scenery
cheap
BX
A
$
$
this
is
the
place
to
be
!
!

Try
the
congee
and
the
donut
like
deep
fried
dough
they
call
Ow
Ley
Soh
,
a
delicious
and
sweet
tasting
bread
.

The
sheer
power
and
flexibility
makes
the
MacBook
Pro
a
must
have
for
any
techie
!

I
found
the
food
to
be
just
as
good
as
its
owner
,
Da
Silvano
,
just
much
less
expensive
.

Everyone
raved
about
the
atmosphere
(
elegant
rooms
and
absolutely
incomparable
views
)
and
the
fabulous
food
!

Food
was
very
good
as
well
,
considering
that
we
tried
the
budget
selection
(
though
I
wish
the
pork
belly
that
I
ordered
was
roasted
a
bit
longer
,
so
that
fat
was
more
of
a
melt-in-your-mouth
experience
)
.

And
really
large
portions
.

The
garlic
mashed
potatoes
are
hands
down
the
best
in
the
city
!

Other
than
not
being
a
fan
of
click
pads
(
industry
standard
these
days
)
and
the
lousy
internal
speakers
,
it
's
hard
for
me
to
find
things
about
this
notebook
I
do
n't
like
,
especially
considering
the
$
350
price
tag
.

Have
never
had
a
problem
with
service
save
a
missing
rice
once
.

The
wait
staff
is
friendly
,
and
the
food
has
gotten
better
and
better
!

I
'm
partial
to
the
Gnocchi
.

MY
date
and
I
both
ordered
the
Branzini
and
both
felt
the
fish
was
very
average
.

Also
consider
the
MS
Office
apps
are
all
trial
versions
,
hope
you
have
your
own
copies
.

it
is
a
hidden
delight
complete
with
a
quaint
bar
and
good
food
.

I
like
the
lighted
screen
at
night
.

I
've
already
upgraded
o
Mavericks
and
I
am
impressed
with
everything
about
this
computer
.

It
was
slow
,
locked
up
,
and
also
had
hardware
replaced
after
only
2
months
!

Other
than
that
its
a
great
performing
machine
and
well
meets
all
my
needs
and
more
.

My
girlfriend
,
being
slightly
more
aggressive
,
and
having
been
equally
disgusted
causing
her
to
throw
out
the
remainder
of
her
barely
eaten
meal
,
called
back
only
to
be
informed
that
I
was
probably
wrong
and
that
it
was
most
likely
an
oyster
,
and
that
we
were
also
blacklisted
from
their
restaurant
.

Lucky
Strike
is
a
great
casual
place
to
just
grab
a
bite
to
eat
.

Our
food
was
great
too
!

There
is
a
downside
if
you
're
ordering
in
--
the
delivery
guys
have
MAJOR
attitude
.

When
I
called
Toshiba
,
they
would
not
do
anything
and
even
tried
to
charge
me
$
35
for
the
phone
call
,
even
though
they
did
n't
offer
any
technical
support
.

A
mac
is
very
easy
to
use
and
it
simply
makes
sense
.

The
kitchen
however
,
is
almost
always
slow
.

I
got
this
at
an
amazing
price
from
Amazon
and
it
arrived
just
in
time
.

My
chicken
was
completely
dried
out
and
on
the
cold
side
and
the
sauce
was
not
very
flavorful
.

Enabling
the
battery
timer
is
useless
.

The
technical
support
was
not
helpful
as
well
.

This
computer
does
n't
do
that
well
with
certain
games
it
ca
n't
play
some
and
it
becomes
too
hot
while
playing
games
.

Food
portion
was
SMALL
and
below
average
.

It
's
fast
,
light
,
and
simple
to
use
.

The
price
very
reasonable
.

honestly
the
worst
sushi
my
husband
and
i
had
in
our
entire
lives
.

The
service
was
very
attentive
and
very
generous
.

The
Like
New
condition
of
the
iMac
MC309LL/A
on
Amazon
is
at
$
900+
level
only
,
and
it
is
a
Quad-Core
2.5
GHz
CPU
(
similar
to
the
$
799
Mini
)
,
with
Radeon
HD
6750M
512MB
graphic
card
(
this
mini
is
integrated
Intel
4000
card
)
,
and
it
even
comes
with
wireless
Apple
Keyboard
and
Mouse
,
all
put
together
in
neat
and
nice
package
.

the
food
was
undercooked
-the
sauce
watery
,
and
the
vegetables
raw
.

The
food
was
good
.

I
recommend
the
meatballs
and
caprese
salad
and
the
beans
on
toast
were
a
wonderful
start
to
the
meal
!

Our
server
was
very
helpful
and
friendly
.

We
recently
decided
to
try
this
location
,
and
to
our
delight
,
they
have
outdoor
seating
,
perfect
since
I
had
my
yorkie
with
me
.

Food
was
good
not
great
not
worth
the
wait
or
another
visit

Big
Wong
gets
big
Ups
for
a
fine
establishment
.

The
secret
is
the
lunch
menu
which
offers
a
complimentary
appetizer
with
every
entree
ordered
.

Too
bad
I
had
paid
an
extra
$
2
for
the
stone
bowl
.

The
hostess
was
rude
and
I
got
a
distinct
feeling
that
they
did
not
want
to
serve
us
.

As
a
retired
hipster
,
I
can
say
with
some
degree
of
certainty
that
for
the
last
year
Lucky
Strike
has
been
the
best
laid-back
late
night
in
the
city
.

The
service
I
received
from
Toshiba
went
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
.

however
,
it
's
the
service
that
leaves
a
bad
taste
in
my
mouth
.

To
sum
it
up
:
Service
varies
from
good
to
mediorce
,
depending
on
which
waiter
you
get
;
generally
it
is
just
average
Ok
.

The
thunderbolt
port
is
awesome
!

The
built
quality
is
really
good
,
I
was
so
Happy
and
excited
about
this
Product
.

I
am
please
with
the
products
ease
of
use
;
out
of
the
box
ready
;
appearance
and
functionality
.

The
stuff
tilapia
was
horrid
...
tasted
like
cardboard
.

I
'm
overall
pleased
with
the
interface
and
the
portability
of
this
product
.

The
hostess
and
the
waitress
were
incredibly
rude
and
did
everything
they
could
to
rush
us
out
.

oh
speaking
of
bathroom
,
the
mens
bathroom
was
disgusting
.

However
,
the
multi-touch
gestures
and
large
tracking
area
make
having
an
external
mouse
unnecessary
(
unless
you
're
gaming
)
.

The
only
thing
that
can
be
updated
is
the
video
,
other
than
that
you
're
all
set
.

The
decor
however
seems
to
be
the
distraction
so
you
wo
n't
notice
that
you
just
payed
300
bucks
for
some
cold
eggplant
that
took
2
FRICKIN
HOURS
TO
COME
!
!
!
!

Great
pizza
and
fantastic
service
.

I
blame
the
Mac
OS
.

And
the
service
was
simply
spendid
-
quite
a
delight
.

Never
have
I
had
such
dramatic
delivery
guys
(
a
lot
of
huffing
and
panting
and
muttering
under
breath
b/c
I
live
in
a
walkup
)
who
always
seem
disappointed
with
their
tips
.

I
took
it
in
to
the
Apple
store
and
guess
what
?
They
fixed
it
,
no
cost
out
of
pocket
.

But
the
staff
was
so
horrible
to
us
.

Pizza
and
garlic
knots
are
great
as
well
,
I
order
from
them
quite
often
and
the
delivery
is
always
super
quick
!

Not
only
is
it
an
adventure
getting
to
this
somewhat
hidden
spot
,
once
you
enter
the
unmarked
wooden
doors
,
the
zen
and
intimate
décor
will
make
you
feel
like
you
’
re
no
longer
in
the
city
.

The
only
thing
i
can
say
is
that
the
touch
pad
doesnt
work
like
it
should
all
the
time
.

Great
neighborhood
joint
.

Wireless
has
not
been
a
issue
for
me
,
like
some
others
have
meantioned
.

The
worst
excuse
for
Japanese
food
I
've
ever
encountered
.

Although
I
moved
uptown
I
try
to
stop
in
as
often
as
possible
for
the
GREAT
cheap
food
and
to
pay
the
friendly
staff
a
visit
.

I
like
Cafe
Noir
dont
get
me
wrong
,
it
is
jsut
that
the
people
who
work
there
are
evil
and
incompetent
!
!

Returned
laptop
for
repair
a
2nd
time
and
it
came
back
with
obvious
physical
damage
(
keyboard
bulging
and
speaker
grill
pressed
in
)
,
buttons
not
working
and
USB
ports
inoperative
.

You
won
’
t
be
disappointed
by
their
menu
.

The
meat
is
fresh
,
the
sauces
are
great
,
you
get
kimchi
and
a
salad
free
with
your
meal
and
service
is
good
too
.

The
bagel
was
huge
.

The
servers
at
Flatbush
Farm
appear
to
have
perfected
that
ghastly
technique
of
making
you
feel
guilty
and
ashamed
for
deigning
to
attract
their
attention
.

I
found
the
food
,
service
and
value
exceptional
everytime
I
have
been
there
.

Sauce
was
watery
and
the
food
did
n't
have
much
flavor
.

Other
guests
enjoyed
pizza
,
santa
fe
chopped
salad
and
fish
and
chips
.

I
've
had
it
for
about
2
months
now
and
found
no
issues
with
software
or
updates
.

The
screen
is
a
little
glary
,
and
I
hated
the
clicking
buttons
,
but
I
got
used
to
them
.

The
spicy
tuna
roll
was
unusually
good
and
the
rock
shrimp
tempura
was
awesome
,
great
appetizer
to
share
!

They
say
that
this
will
invalidate
the
warranty
on
the
hard
drive
(
I
do
n't
really
understand
why
but
anyway
)
.

Just
straight
up
cheap
,
good
food
.

I
respond
that
I
do
not
have
the
old
computer
and
this
way
I
would
lose
the
data
on
my
hard
drive
.

The
food
is
tasty
and
portion
sizes
are
appropriate
.

The
performance
is
awesome
.

Too
bad
I
had
paid
an
extra
$
2
for
the
stone
bowl
.

We
have
gone
for
dinner
only
a
few
times
but
the
same
great
quality
and
service
is
given
.

I
particularly
love
their
yellowfun
tuna
and
their
mussel
selection
.

Great
Indian
food

The
martinis
are
amazing
and
very
fairly
priced
.

After
really
enjoying
ourselves
at
the
bar
we
sat
down
at
a
table
and
had
dinner
.

The
service
was
excellent
and
the
food
was
delicious
.

Seriously
,
this
place
kicks
ass
.

While
this
is
a
pretty
place
in
that
overly
cute
French
way
,
the
food
was
insultingly
horrible
.

The
staff
was
knowledgeable
and
full
of
personality
.

The
best
part
of
the
experience
was
knowing
that
the
manager
(
a
bubbly
,
friendly
young
woman
with
a
great
smile
)
truly
cared
about
how
we
were
doing
.

Raga
's
is
a
romantic
,
cozy
restaurant
.

It
is
fast
booting
up
,
shutting
down
,
and
connection
with
the
internet
.

To
the
owners
;
good
job
guys
,
this
place
is
a
keeper
!

The
only
bad
thing
about
it
is
they
give
you
the
worst
batteries
possible
.

you
can
actually
get
2
salads
worth
if
u
take
it
home
and
add
it
to
some
lettuce
!

My
laptop
with
Windows
7
crashed
and
I
did
not
want
Windows
8
.

I
use
this
for
my
tutoring
business
,
and
since
I
'm
always
bouncing
from
student
to
student
,
it
is
ideal
for
portability
and
battery
life
(
yes
,
it
gets
the
8
hours
as
advertised
!
)
.

The
food
is
great
and
the
prices
are
reasonable
.

Of
course
the
reason
its
so
packed
is
because
the
food
is
so
delicious
!

apple
has
a
reputation
and
is
well
known
for
its
easy
usage
.

Not
only
is
the
food
authentic
,
but
the
staff
here
are
practically
off-the-boat
,
they
are
young
and
hip
and
know
what
they
are
doing
when
it
comes
to
food
and
wine
.

It
has
a
faster
processor
and
more
ram
.

The
Prix
Fixe
menu
is
worth
every
penny
and
you
get
more
than
enough
(
both
in
quantity
AND
quality
)
.

A
quintessential
slice
of
NYC
pizza
.

this
computer
will
last
you
at
least
7
years
,
thats
an
amazing
life
spanned
an
electronic
.

It
really
is
perfect
for
work
and
play
.

We
ordered
the
special
,
grilled
branzino
,
that
was
so
infused
with
bone
,
it
was
difficult
to
eat
.

The
restaurant
offers
an
extensive
wine
list
and
an
ambiance
you
wo
n't
forget
!

Great
food
,
great
decor
,
great
service
.

I
have
other
computers
that
get
strong
signals
that
do
n't
drop
in
places
that
this
``
net
''
book
loses
its
signal
.

Though
the
picture
,
video
,
and
music
software
is
nowhere
close
to
professional
grade
software
Im
used
to
(
CS5
)
but
does
the
job
for
beginner
and
even
intermediate
media
designers
.

It
was
like
the
servers
forgot
that
they
actually
worked
there
and
instead
wanted
to
hang
out
and
be
cool
.

Waitstaff
are
very
friendly
.

mojitos
and
the
service
are
the
best
part
in
there

I
had
their
eggs
benedict
for
brunch
,
which
were
the
worst
in
my
entire
life
,
I
tried
removing
the
hollondaise
sauce
completely
that
was
how
failed
it
was
.

Everything
was
wonderful
;
food
,
drinks
,
staff
,
mileau
.

There
is
no
excuse
for
such
lousy
service
!

The
chicken
and
falafel
platters
were
nondescript
combinations
with
fresh
leaf
salad
.

Looks
nice
,
but
has
a
horribly
cheap
feel
.

The
keyboard
is
slick
and
quiet
and
not
bulky
like
some
other
laptops
I
have
had
in
the
past
.

Speaking
of
the
browser
,
it
too
has
problems
.

Not
sure
where
the
previous
reviewer
,
lonk
,
dined
,
but
Saul
is
in
a
great
neighborhood
and
has
great
food
!

this
little
place
has
a
cute
interior
decor
and
affordable
city
prices
.

Simple
to
use
,
and
great
graphics
.

the
all-u-can-eat
sushi
is
definitely
in
very
poor
quality
.

The
unibody
design
is
edgy
and
durable
.

–
Ray
's
is
THE
place
to
go
for
high
quality
seafood
dinners
.

I
appreciate
their
delivery
too
.

For
great
chinese
food
nearby
,
you
have
Wu
Liang
Ye
and
Grand
Sichuan
just
a
block
away
.

I
like
the
design
and
its
features
but
there
are
somethings
I
think
needs
to
be
improved
.

The
food
here
was
mediocre
at
best
.

The
bar
drinks
were
Eh
,
ok
to
say
the
least
.

But
when
you
are
seated
the
waitresses
are
great
,
they
explain
everything
on
the
menu
,
and
the
price
of
the
food
is
really
cheap
for
the
service
you
get
.

This
place
is
so
much
fun
.

The
food
here
does
a
great
service
to
the
name
(
Cantonese
that
is
...
)
.

-Computer
crashed
frequently
and
battery
life
decreased
very
quickly
.

Rao
is
a
good
restaurant
,
but
it
's
nothing
special
.

It
is
easy
to
go
from
one
keyboard
to
another
.

The
seats
are
uncomfortable
if
you
are
sitting
against
the
wall
on
wooden
benches
.

We
did
n't
want
a
bottle
of
bubbly
on
a
weekday
so
we
each
got
little
bottles
of
Korbett
it
was
just
enough
.

Very
poor
customer
service
.

I
like
the
design
and
ease
of
use
with
the
keyboard
,
plenty
of
ports
.

This
place
has
totally
weird
decor
,
stairs
going
up
with
mirrored
walls
-
I
am
surprised
how
no
one
yet
broke
their
head
or
fall
off
the
stairs
-
mirrored
walls
make
you
dizzy
and
delusional
...

Big
Wong
gets
big
Ups
for
a
fine
establishment
.

With
the
theater
2
blocks
away
we
had
a
delicious
meal
in
a
beautiful
room
.

The
decor
in
this
place
is
very
diner-ish
and
the
kind
of
place
you
expect
in
the
East
Village
-
not
romantic
,
just
simple
,
small
and
sparse
.

The
food
is
excellent
!

I
highly
recommend
this
beautiful
place
.

If
you
're
looking
for
a
great
meal
at
a
decent
price
,
go
to
Del
Frisco
's
!

Just
because
it
's
cheap
does
NOT
mean
the
portions
are
small
or
the
food
is
nasty
,
IT
IS
GREAT
!

Open
&
Cool
Place
with
the
Best
Pizza
and
Coffee

I
stumbled
upon
this
great
pizzeria
as
I
explored
my
new
neighborhood
.

Waitstaff
are
very
friendly
.

The
screen
,
the
software
and
the
smoothness
of
the
operating
system
.

All
in
all
,
I
would
return
-
as
it
was
a
beautiful
restaurant
-
but
I
hope
the
staff
pays
more
attention
to
the
little
details
in
the
future
.

Mac
also
has
many
apps
and
programs
that
are
quite
cheap
or
free
.

If
you
go
to
Roth
's
try
to
be
served
by
Mike
,
he
is
GREAT
!
!

The
wine
list
is
excellent
.

Also
,
the
chick
peas
with
shrimp
(
appetizer
)
is
divine
.

I
took
one
bite
from
the
$
24
salmon
,
and
I
have
never
,
in
the
17
years
I
have
been
going
to
restaurants
tasted
salmon
as
fishy
,
as
dry
,
and
as
bland
as
the
one
in
Flatbush
Farms
.

Sure
it
has
the
one
touch
keys
but
that
was
the
best
feature
of
the
computer
.

the
drinks
are
amazing
and
half
off
till
8pm
.

Now
,
as
easy
as
it
is
to
use
,
and
I
do
think
it
is
a
great
STARTER
laptop
.

If
you
go
,
try
the
marinara/arrabiatta
sauce
,
the
mozzarella
en
Carozza
is
mmmmmmmm
...
..
everything
is
just
delicious
.

the
graphics
are
awful
and
the
wireless
switch
it
at
the
top
rather
than
the
side
which
I
am
used
to
it
being
on
the
side
.

I
had
a
USB
connect
but
,
i
ca
n't
use
it
because
it
is
not
compatible
.

The
staff
is
pretty
friendly
.

Aside
from
the
trial
software
and
the
short
battery
life
,
lack
of
a
webcam
,
its
great
.

This
place
is
pricey
,
and
yes
,
the
food
is
worth
it
;
but
the
service
makes
you
feel
like
you
should
be
paying
a
quater
of
the
price
.

Food
was
very
good
,
but
not
what
I
would
consider
out
of
this
world
.

The
staff
members
are
extremely
friendly
and
even
replaced
my
drink
once
when
I
dropped
it
outside
.

They
serve
it
in
a
tall
,
skinny
hour-glass
shaped
glass
to
disguise
the
fact
that
you
a
getting
a
small
juice
at
the
price
of
a
half
gallon
in
a
supermarket
.

They
do
n't
just
look
good
;
they
deliver
excellent
performance
.

Their
twist
on
pizza
is
healthy
,
but
full
of
flavor
.

The
Thai
food
is
good
.

My
first
problem
was
with
the
pre-loaded
Norton
Firewall/Security
program
.

The
Yellowtail
was
particularly
good
as
well
.

Yamato
is
an
excellent
place
to
go
if
youre
not
into
sashimi
,
or
if
you
have
friends
who
doesnt
like
sushi
much
.

We
love
the
food
,
drinks
,
and
atmosphere
!

This
place
is
not
worth
the
prices
.

Overall
I
feel
this
netbook
was
poor
quality
,
had
poor
performance
,
although
it
did
have
great
battery
life
when
it
did
work
.

I
found
the
food
to
be
outstanding
,
particulary
the
salmon
dish
I
had
.

Their
specialty
rolls
are
impressive
,
though
I
ca
n't
remember
what
we
had
.

This
laptop
meets
every
expectation
and
Windows
7
is
great
!

Good
luck
getting
a
table
.

The
operating
system
and
user
interface
is
very
intuitive
,
and
the
large
multi-touch
track
pad
is
amazing
.

And
if
you
have
a
iphone
or
ipod
touch
you
can
connect
and
download
songs
to
it
at
high
speed
.

From
the
complimentary
chef
app
of
a
delicate
butternut
squash
ravioli
in
a
delicious
truffle
sauce
to
an
amazing
buttery
and
tender
langostine
entree
to
a
dessert
that
I
ca
n't
remember
because
of
the
fabulous
Cakebread
Cabernet
we
were
drinking
--
the
whole
evening
was
amazing
.

My
husband
said
the
portions
were
very
small
,
but
if
my
main
course
was
good
to
eat
the
portion
would
've
been
fine
for
me
.

love
the
food
.

And
having
to
deal
with
the
company
has
been
a
even
worse
nightmare
.

The
graphics
are
stunning
.

Never
have
I
had
such
dramatic
delivery
guys
(
a
lot
of
huffing
and
panting
and
muttering
under
breath
b/c
I
live
in
a
walkup
)
who
always
seem
disappointed
with
their
tips
.

We
waited
at
the
bar
and
had
martinis
that
were
just
right
.

the
wait
staff
is
very
friendly
,
if
your
not
rude
or
picky
...
...
.our
meal
at
Leon
last
weekend
was
great
-
.

Reason
why
?
It
's
because
when
you
buy
it
,
you
know
first
thing
that
you
will
not
lose
any
value
for
that
laptop
,
the
price
will
stay
the
same
for
the
next
year
,
and
even
if
Apple
does
decides
to
change
mode
,
your
laptop
value
will
only
drop
10-20
%
,
unlike
PC
laptops
which
drop
more
than
80
%
.

The
pizza
was
great
.

All
in
all
the
food
was
good
-
a
little
on
the
expensive
side
,
but
fresh
.

They
offer
the
best
warranty
in
the
business
,
and
do
n't
3rd
party
it
out
like
Toshiba
.

Oh
,
and
I
never
write
reviews
--
I
just
was
so
moved
by
how
bad
this
place
was
,
I
felt
it
was
my
duty
to
spread
the
word
.

Patroon
features
a
nice
cigar
bar
and
has
great
staff
.

Even
though
it
is
running
Snow
Leopard
,
2.4
GHz
C2D
is
a
bit
of
an
antiquated
CPU
and
thus
the
occasional
spinning
wheel
would
appear
when
running
Office
Mac
applications
such
as
Word
or
Excel
.

The
absolute
worst
service
I
've
ever
experienced
and
the
food
was
below
average
(
when
they
actually
gave
people
the
meals
they
ordered
)
.

This
place
is
worth
an
one-hour
drive
.

A
different
server
enhanced
the
fun
,
dumping
our
entrees
in
front
of
us
halfway
through
our
appetizer
(
which
was
delicious
)
.

Service
is
usually
pretty
good
.

The
Waitstaff
were
very
nice
and
suggested
swordfish
for
my
husband
he
enjoyed
his
meal
.

The
presentation
of
Snooze
is
excellent
and
it
is
one
of
those
places
that
you
feel
more
sophisticated
just
for
being
there
;
but
peel
back
the
layers
and
you
have
an
overpriced
IHOP
with
a
high
brow
menu
.

The
display
is
incredibly
bright
,
much
brighter
than
my
PowerBook
and
very
crisp
.

Warm
and
friendly
in
the
winter
and
terrific
outdoor
seating
in
the
warmer
months
.

This
place
has
great
indian
chinese
food
.

I
love
when
restaurants
think
using
fancy
expensive
ingrediants
makes
the
food
fine
cuisine
,
even
with
no
idea
how
to
use
them
.

We
went
around
9:30
on
a
Friday
and
it
had
died
down
a
bit
by
then
so
the
service
was
great
!

The
burger
was
great
,
also
.

We
ordered
the
chicken
casserole
,
but
what
we
got
were
a
few
small
pieces
of
chicken
,
all
dark
meat
and
on
the
bone
.

Make
sure
you
try
this
place
as
often
as
you
can
.

The
Yellowtail
was
particularly
good
as
well
.

You
get
what
you
pay
for
and
with
that
logic
in
mind
,
Spice
is
a
great
place
to
grab
some
cheap
eats
and
drinks
in
a
beautiful
setting
.

The
waitstaff
is
solicitous
and
friendly
and
always
seems
glad
to
see
us
,
and
the
food
is
wonderful
,
if
not
stunningly
creative
.

The
room
is
a
little
plain
,
but
it
's
difficult
to
make
such
a
small
place
exciting
and
I
would
not
suggest
that
as
a
reason
not
to
go
.

The
pro
is
a
great
product
,
I
wish
that
the
13
inch
models
came
with
the
Intel
i
processors
and
had
a
more
comfortable
edge
(
the
edges
hurt
my
wrists
)
.

Try
their
chef
's
specials
--
they
are
to
die
for
.

My
one
complaint
is
that
there
was
no
internal
CD
drive
.

I
love
the
atmorphere
@
peep
!

The
13
''
Macbook
Pro
just
fits
in
my
budget
and
with
free
shipping
and
no
tax
to
CA
this
is
the
best
price
we
can
get
for
a
great
product
.

This
is
my
first
time
writing
a
review
for
a
restaurant
because
the
food
and
service
was
excellent
.

I
recently
went
to
this
restaurant
with
some
co-workers
for
lunch
and
had
an
amazing
time
.

Haru
serves
very
fresh
fish
,
has
a
trendy
,
modern
ambiance
,
prime
location
on
Park
Avenue
South
and
friendly
service
.

Great
draft
and
bottle
selection
and
the
pizza
rocks
.

Fish
is
so
very
fresh
.

The
portions
are
very
large
and
the
service
is
fantastic
!
!

Food
is
usually
very
good
,
though
ocasionally
I
wondered
about
freshmess
of
raw
vegatables
in
side
orders
.

The
staff
has
always
been
attentive
and
kind
,
and
I
've
always
been
amazed
at
how
they
've
handled
all
the
various
different
group
sizes
that
come
in
.

In
Grammercy/Union
Square/East
Village
this
is
my
neighbors
and
my
favorite
spot
.

And
forget
what
you
read
under
me
,
the
atmosphere
is
n't
that
bad
either
.

The
games
included
are
very
good
games
.

The
portion
sizes
here
are
huge
,
and
the
sushi
is
good
.

Your
money
could
easily
be
better
spent
elsewhere
(
Anywhere
)
.

Staff
is
very
accomodating
.

And
as
for
all
the
fancy
finger
swipes
--
I
just
gave
up
and
attached
a
mouse
.

Gross
food
–
Wow-

Stepping
into
Casa
La
Femme
last
night
was
a
true
experience
unlike
any
other
in
New
York
!

Tech
support
tells
me
the
latter
problem
is
a
power
supply
problem
and
have
offered
to
fix
it
if
it
happens
again
.

Their
eggplant
is
so
delicate
,
sweet
tender
!

for
about
eleven
bucks
you
get
a
gigantic
burrito
(
or
tacos
)
,
margarita
,
and
dessert
.

I
have
eaten
at
Saul
,
many
times
,
the
food
is
always
consistently
,
outrageously
good
.

Mine
was
a
little
burnt
but
still
delicious
with
goat
cheese
and
panchetta
(
raddichio
was
kind
of
bitter
though
)
.

Planet
Thai
is
great
!

As
usual
the
omikase
did
n't
disappoint
in
freshness
,
although
it
scored
low
on
creativity
and
selection
.

The
atmosphere
is
nothing
special
,
but
it
feels
like
a
Sushi
establishment
in
Tokyo
.

Their
sake
list
was
extensive
,
but
we
were
looking
for
Purple
Haze
,
which
was
n't
listed
but
made
for
us
upon
request
!

This
Macbook
Pro
is
fast
,
powerful
,
and
runs
super
quiet
and
cool
.

My
friend
enjoyed
the
grilled
Alaskan
King
Salmon
with
delectable
creamed
Washington
russet
potatoes
and
crisp
green
beans
.

But
we
had
paid
for
bluetooth
,
and
there
was
none
.

The
new
MBP
offers
great
portability
and
gives
us
confidence
that
we
are
not
going
to
need
to
purchase
a
new
laptop
in
18
months
.

Best
.
Sushi
.
Ever
.

Okay
service
.

Service
was
quick
.

The
service
was
excellent
and
the
food
was
delicious
.

The
place
has
a
nice
fit-out
,
some
attractive
furnishings
and
,
from
what
I
could
tell
,
a
reasonable
wine
list
(
I
was
given
the
food
menu
when
I
asked
for
the
carte
des
vins
)

Very
immature
bartender
,
didnt
know
how
to
make
specific
drinks
,
service
was
so
slowwwww
,
the
food
was
not
fresh
or
warm
,
waitresses
were
busy
flirting
with
men
at
the
bar
and
werent
very
attentive
to
all
the
customers
.

The
drinks
are
great
,
especially
when
made
by
Raymond
.

I
have
worked
in
restaurants
and
cook
a
lot
,
and
there
is
no
way
a
maggot
should
be
able
to
get
into
well
prepared
food
.

We
could
have
made
a
meal
of
the
yummy
dumplings
from
the
dumpling
menu
.

It
'
only
open
for
lunch
but
the
food
is
so
good
!

Yeah
,
of
course
smarty
pants
``
fix
it
now
''

Software
-
Compared
to
the
early
2011
edition
I
did
see
inbuilt
applications
crashing
and
it
prompted
me
to
send
the
report
to
Apple
(
which
I
promptly
did
)
.

The
service
is
excellent
,
the
decor
is
great
,
and
the
food
is
delicious
and
comes
in
large
portions
.

Staffs
are
not
that
friendly
,
but
the
taste
covers
all
.

The
food
was
below
average
,
the
service
was
pathetic
,
there
was
no
ambience
at
all
.

Yes
,
they
use
fancy
ingredients
,
but
even
fancy
ingredients
do
n't
make
for
good
pizza
unless
someone
knows
how
to
get
the
crust
right
.

Wine
list
is
extensive
without
being
over-priced
.

Yes
,
the
place
is
classy
and
beautiful
,
but
they
most
certainly
target
the
uber
whealthy
Not
the
common
joe
that
wants
to
go
all
out
every
once
in
a
while
.

The
spicy
tuna
roll
was
unusually
good
and
the
rock
shrimp
tempura
was
awesome
,
great
appetizer
to
share
!

The
laptop
is
relatively
simple
to
use
,
though
I
bought
Macs
for
Dummies
,
which
is
well
worth
$
2

It
's
silent
and
has
a
very
small
footprint
on
my
desk
.

The
video
card
is
great
for
media
,
and
above
average
for
gaming
,
but
not
a
gamers
first
choice
.

the
retina
display
display
make
pictures
i
took
years
ago
jaw
dropping
.

We
ordered
a
selection
of
the
small
plates
,
and
the
shoe
string
onions
,
goat
cheese
pizza
,
grilled
asparagus
and
fried
brie
with
fruit
were
all
very
good
.

The
only
thing
I
miss
is
that
my
old
Alienware
laptop
had
backlit
keys
.

The
tuna
and
wasabe
potatoes
are
excellent
.

Although
small
,
it
has
beautiful
ambience
,
excellent
food
(
the
catfish
is
delicious
-
if
ya
do
n't
mind
it
a
lil
salty
)
and
attentive
service
.

The
nakgi-bokum
was
horrible
.

The
speed
difference
is
next
to
NOTHING
for
a
mac
,
and
the
hard
drive
can
be
manually
upgraded
or
you
could
just
buy
a
$
60
500gb
external
hard
drive
.

The
fish
is
fresh
but
the
variety
of
fish
is
nothing
out
of
ordinary
.

Even
better
,
they
know
how
to
cook
French
classics
like
Steak
au
Poivre
and
Onglet
without
burning
it
to
death
or
overcooking
it
.

The
pizza
is
delicious
and
the
proprietor
is
one
of
the
nicest
in
NYC
.

I
've
been
impressed
with
the
battery
life
and
the
performance
for
such
a
small
amount
of
memory
.

The
dishes
offered
were
unique
,
very
tasty
and
fresh
from
the
lamb
sausages
,
sardines
with
biscuits
,
large
whole
shrimp
to
the
amazing
pistachio
ice
cream
(
the
best
and
freshest
I
've
ever
had
)
.

That
included
the
extra
Sony
Sonic
Stage
software
,
the
speakers
and
the
subwoofer
I
got
(
that
WAS
worth
the
money
)
,
the
bluetooth
mouse
for
my
supposedly
bluetooth
enabled
computer
,
the
extended
life
battery
and
the
Docking
port
.

From
the
spectacular
caviar
to
the
hospitable
waitstaff
,
I
felt
like
royalty
and
enjoyed
every
second
of
it
.

great
battery
life
.

The
pizza
is
yummy
and
I
like
the
atmoshpere
.

Everything
is
so
easy
and
intuitive
to
setup
or
configure
.

I
can
barely
use
any
usb
devices
because
they
will
not
stay
connected
properly
.

The
Mac
Mini
is
probably
the
simplest
example
of
compact
computing
out
there
.

Food
was
okay
,
nothing
great
.

Simple
healthy
unglamorous
food
cheap
.

The
best
pad
thai
i
've
ever
had
.

The
food
is
definitely
good
,
but
I
left
a
bit
disappointed
.

The
pizza
was
pretty
good
and
huge
.

fine
dining
restaurant
quality
.

The
space
is
nice
but
when
we
order
our
drink
we
were
in
for
a
surprise
.

I
have
never
better
enjoyed
humble
root
vegetables
or
a
mushroom
consomme
-
and
this
chef
accomplishes
without
fats
.

We
were
4
and
got
the
family
size
penne
a
la
vodka
which
was
tremendously
gigantic
portion
...
a
bucket
of
food
literally
.

The
food
here
is
rather
good
,
but
only
if
you
like
to
wait
for
it
.

The
have
over
100
different
beers
to
offer
thier
guest
so
that
made
my
husband
very
happy
and
the
food
was
delicious
,
if
I
must
recommend
a
dish
it
must
be
the
pumkin
tortelini
.

Great
battery
,
speed
,
display
.

The
pizza
was
delivered
cold
and
the
cheese
was
n't
even
fully
melted
!

Web
browsing
is
very
quick
with
Safari
browser
.

The
sound
was
crappy
even
when
you
turn
up
the
volume
still
the
same
results
.

I
have
enjoyed
everything
I
have
ever
gotten
and
the
fish
is
so
fresh
and
always
prepared
in
a
great
way
.

The
veal
was
incredible
last
night
.

So
,
for
good
food
i
'd
recommend
it
,
but
not
for
a
fun
night
out
.

The
restaurant
is
dark
and
not
very
attractive
and
then
you
have
spot
lights
shining
on
you
putting
you
in
the
worst
light
possible
,
reaching
for
sunglasses
.

Dessert
:
pure
disaster
.

i
've
been
to
sapphire
twice
and
both
times
the
food
was
fine
,
if
not
good
.

Service
is
fast
and
friendly
.

The
band
was
very
good
and
the
service
was
attentive
.

The
sushi
is
always
fresh
and
yummy
and
the
menu
is
pretty
varied
.

Winnie
and
her
staff
are
the
best
crew
you
can
find
serving
you
.

The
restaurant
looks
out
over
beautiful
green
lawns
to
the
Hudson
River
and
the
Statue
of
Liberty
.

The
food
was
excellent
as
well
as
service
,
however
,
I
left
The
Four
Seasons
very
dissappointed
.

We
had
the
pot-stickers
which
were
great
and
a
tempura
dish
that
was
great
.

Rao
's
has
the
best
service
and
atmosphere
in
NYC
.

Try
the
congee
and
the
donut
like
deep
fried
dough
they
call
Ow
Ley
Soh
,
a
delicious
and
sweet
tasting
bread
.

the
features
are
great
,
the
only
thing
it
needs
is
better
speakers
.

Cute
place
,
nice
wait
staff
but
would
never
go
there
again
.

The
keyboard
is
top
notch
.

since
then
i
have
had
minor
problems
with
slow
operation
.

In
an
area
sadly
lacking
in
decent
Thai
food
,
this
is
one
of
the
best
spots
.

Great
Shabu
Shabu

It
was
such
a
fantastic
dining
experience
,
that
I
returned
again
the
same
week
.

It
was
a
great
laptop
,
ran
great
and
was
really
fast
.

A
cool
bar
with
great
food
,
and
tons
of
excellent
beer
.

The
place
is
small
and
intimate
and
you
may
feel
a
little
crowded
,
but
the
service
is
excellent
and
it
's
great
for
friends
out
,
a
romantic
date
,
or
a
special
occassion
.

The
ambience
was
nice
,
but
service
was
n't
so
great
.

We
had
Pam
's
special
fried
fish
and
it
was
amazing
.

The
hot
dogs
are
good
,
yes
,
but
the
reason
to
get
over
here
is
the
fantastic
pork
croquette
sandwich
,
perfect
on
its
supermarket
squishy
bun
.

Great
wine
selection
,
Gigondas
is
worth
the
price
,
and
the
house
champagne
is
a
great
value
.

Overall
,
decent
food
at
a
good
price
,
with
friendly
people
.

A
SECOND
PROBLEM
INVOLVES
THE
BATTERY
WHICH
IS
ADVERTISED
AS
HAVING
A
STORAGE
LIFE
OF
11
HOURS
BUT
WHEN
FULLY
CHARGED
SHOWS
ONLY
7
HOURS
OF
SERVICE
.

Pizza
here
is
consistently
good
.

This
is
undoubtedly
my
favorite
modern
Japanese
brasserie
(
that
don
’
t
serve
sushi
)
,
and
in
my
opinion
,
one
of
the
most
romantic
restaurants
in
the
city
!

The
wine
list
is
also
really
nice
.

Nice
view
of
river
and
NYC
.

Taxan
delicious
!

Wasted
me
at
least
8
hours
of
installation
time
.

This
place
has
the
best
Indian
food
in
New
York
,
hands
down
.

Great
spot
,
whether
looking
for
a
couple
of
drinks
or
quiet
dinner
.

Thius
is
a
must
for
anyone
who
loves
Shabu-Shabu
.

The
sides
were
ok
and
incredibly
salty
.

Had
a
lovely
dinner
in
this
dedicated
seafood
joint
,
food
was
well-prepared
and
-presented
and
the
service
was
pleasant
and
prompt
.

Great
friendly
service
,
Fast
seating
,
Fast
Delivery
,
Excellent
sushi
.

The
food
was
just
OK
,
I
would
never
go
back
.

I
have
NEVER
been
disappointed
in
the
Red
Eye
.

We
have
been
to
this
place
many
times
,
and
always
have
great
food
,
wine
,
and
service
.

Service
was
quick
.

It
works
fine
,
and
all
the
software
seems
to
run
pretty
well
.

I
can
not
imagine
a
friendlier
staff
working
in
a
restaurant
.

The
ambience
is
very
calm
and
quiet
.

The
resolution
on
the
screen
is
almost
pure
HD
.

The
service
is
good
and
the
resturant
is
clean
.

my
niece
and
nephew
have
played
a
few
web
games
and
it
runs
anything
that
does
n't
require
a
dedicated
video
card
.

I
noticed
windows
has
a
new
system
called
Windows
7
,
what
about
us
Vista
users
?
They
should
get
all
the
bugs
out
of
Vista
before
investing
in
a
new
system
.

the
mushroom
barley
soup
is
amazing
.

I
have
to
highly
recommend
the
lobster
roll
-
not
to
much
mayo
;
you
can
tell
it
was
a
fresh
lobster
.

Every
course
was
better
than
the
next
.

The
Mac
version
of
Microsoft
Office
is
cheaper
than
buying
the
actual
and
works
just
as
well
.

it
has
all
the
features
that
we
expected
and
the
price
was
good
,
working
well
so
far
.

However
,
I
think
Jeckll
and
Hydes
t
is
one
of
those
places
that
is
fun
to
do
once
.

The
fact
that
the
screen
reacts
to
the
lighting
around
you
is
an
added
luxury
-when
you
are
working
around
others
in
dark
areas
and
want
privacy
or
do
n't
want
to
bother
them
with
bright
lighting
,
it
is
very
convenient
to
have
a
darker
,
softer
lit
screen
.

for
an
appetizer
,
their
calamari
is
a
winner
.

I
could
save
ten
essay
papers
and
have
hardly
any
memory
left
.

Great
bagels
made
the
old-fashioned
way
.

On
a
recent
trip
,
our
waiter
was
extremely
dismissive
,
while
no
less
than
three
staff
members
waited
hand-and-foot
on
a
pair
of
Japanese
girls
seated
nearby
.

At
first
,
I
feel
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
in
using
the
Mac
system
.

The
food
however
,
is
what
one
might
expect
.

Best
dish
is
nori-wrapped
tuna
.

I
seem
to
be
having
repeat
problems
as
the
Mother
Board
in
this
one
is
diagnosed
as
faulty
,
related
to
the
graphics
card
.

His
drinks
are
very
inventive
,
delicious
and
classy
.

However
,
if
you
want
great
food
at
a
great
price
and
do
n't
mind
the
decor
,
you
ca
n't
beat
this
place
.

Seems
like
maybe
a
bad
shipment
from
Toshiba
.

I
did
swap
out
the
hard
drive
for
a
Samsung
830
SSD
which
I
highly
recommend
.

Best
Indian
Restaurant
in
the
City

Sure
it
's
not
light
and
slim
but
the
features
make
up
for
it
100
%
.

Most
of
the
servers
are
very
attentive
,
friendly
and
quite
attractive
.

Amazing
Quality
!

WHAT
ELSE
CAN
YOU
SAY
NICE
PEOPLE
AMAZING
FOOD
WOW

However
,
the
service
is
absolutely
horrible
.

The
service
was
great
,
and
they
have
a
whole
great
deal
for
birthdays
.

Its
white
color
is
stylish
for
college
students
and
easy
to
take
to
carry
and
take
to
classes
.

I
am
not
a
vegetarian
but
,
almost
all
the
dishes
were
great
.

It
did
fairly
well
,
other
than
it
's
poor
performance
,
overheating
and
occational
blue
screen
.

The
fish
was
not
fresh
and
the
rice
tasted
old
and
stale
.

the
spinach
is
fresh
,
definately
not
frozen
...
